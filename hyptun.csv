272,"and to be honest with you I felt like  that election was the worst decision one  would have to make you know what I mean  I don't think that election really gave  the America that's what I'm telling you  yeah you couldn't yeah you know what I'm  saying is like fucked up and fucked up  er you know what I'm saying and I um  the thing the Hillary had that was the  edge on her that everyone wanted to see  the first female president sure I'd love  it to be a woman that didn't a war  monger and a lion which well lay in bed  with the Russians massively oh my god  speaking of the rest so look we talked  about your contribution to the election  of the president what about the Russians  you're a conspiracy theorist what  happened there oh I got to tell you  that's a case of Hillary did uranium one  gave him 25 percent of our uranium she  was in deep trouble Robert Muller had  been the bagman delivering him uranium  on the tarmac she'd done a legal deal  with the Russians but she was Secretary  of State so they knew that Trump was  able to use that against him so they  sent in all these agents to try to set  up Trump and his people to make deals  the Russians but they didn't really  exist also you can go to Russia and buy  box of the Internet advertising 80% of  it that was done was for Hillary and so  that was all just a big smokescreen to  make it look like the election of Donald  Trump wasn't legitimate yeah and that's  why the whole thing's turned out to be a  hoax it's like Brett Kavanaugh a Supreme  Court justice  two women have just gone public and said  we were never called we never met him  these are the women that were saying  these were the women they were saying in  the news he had sexually assaulted it  was just made up so you say brick have  another sexual assault in no way that's  what you're saying in every case except  for bilasa are you saying brick Kevin  assaulted know what I'm saying that that  absolu they've had no proof there were  no branch 11 assaulted no bad yeah 35 40  years ago there's no police reports no  witnesses at the time and almost all the  people have said that they were  threatened to say it or that they were  paid to said almost listen because it  said furball Ozzie Ford okay belies it  forward all right the evil chipmunk  whatever this this this this this this  bottle of water you're drinking  it's approximately eight ounces correct  if I drop a fraction of an ounce of shit  water in there I'm not gonna drink you  dig what I'm saying you dig it I'm  saying so one little drop of shit water  makes an entire bar but there's water  undrinkable does it matters due process  I ask does it net but you're famous what  are you gonna do 30 years from now  people lie don't lie about you  I ain't rate nobody I ain't rape nobody  everything that's done around me and is  done and my company and my pressure  saying is all fair and and and and  consistently I've never sweat but if you  look at me you see I ain't got to you  look at Brett Kavanaugh you know but it  under due process this is just me under  the process you can speak it as a play  you can't forty years later when you  don't have any witnesses and it turns  out just this week they did it to Bill  Cosby how come they can't do it to Brett  Kavanaugh they did it to be a Cosby I  don't think Bill Cosby deserves to be in  prison I've said that and people  criticized before they don't have any  but these women go up to these hotel  rooms and their Playboy Bunnies and then  they claim 40 years ago or 30 years ago  he drugged him okay I mean they listen  to due process that's what their statute  limitations right you're supposed to  make the listen I had NPR uh-huh go and  interview people from high high school  okay they said that I beat up 30 nerds  started a fight with a nerd I wasn't a  bully right that's a damn lie so you  know when you get lied about like that  you start not believing the stuff you  see out there where they don't have any  proof and there's the thing thing I can  say you just raped me in that bathroom  if I don't have proof I don't have it  you didn't rape me in the bathroom I  appreciate you saying you know what I'm  saying I understand where you coming  from and what you're saying but you do  know that there are some there's some  tangled webs of misconception sure can I  just say there's stuff absolutely all  the studies show that 3G 4G and 5g give  humans and  they tested on giant brain tumors okay  it's true that breast cancer that is  estrogen positive is up over 3,000  percent who and it was incredibly rare  everywhere and took glyphosate was put  out there right and now we know and they  found in court they found scientifically  they knew right that glyphosate mm-hmm  from that big company right was giving  people cancer I was covering it 25 years  ago and getting threatened to shut up I  didn't shut up I had the scientists on  he grows prostate cancer  it grows regio 5g and glyphosate all of  it and so where do you find glyphosate  it's in every water table in the Western  world every water table it's in the  water  it's in the odds like fluoride okay  fluoride was used in the Soviet Union in  the water supply and forced labor camps  to make people docile and infertile so  right when the the Nazis and the  Russians started World War two were  allies they divided Poland this is all  in pulls approximately books right  Stalin gave Hitler the fluoride system  to suppress people right then in 1949  they start putting in our water there's  thousands of studies that lowers IQ  there are thousands of studies it  reduces fertility I'm not saying this  because you're an African American I  have that all the scientists on top  toxicology I want you to see it set for  whatever reason fluoride hurts women  right about three times less than men  because of women's blood-brain barrier  okay it hurts men three times more and  then it hurts black men twice what it  hurts any other man genetically so why  does it hurt black me and more  genetically that is on average and  that's in Harvard study but is there a  reason that's a gamma study just type in  fluoride hurts blacks more than than any  other group and men particularly okay  and it deals with some type of issue  with the blood-brain barrier and of  course that's all averages people pretty  close but there's different averages and  this and that and if you just look it up  you'll know it's really hitting black  people tell me fluoride on anyone any  male that drinks it lowers IQ massively  any Mayo any male not female women not  as much okay is there blood-brain  barrier they gotta be able to carry a  child they got a much stronger  blood-brain barrier  gotcha a woman's gotta be able to have a  baby with a different blood type that  that you know Pisa  probably sometimes crap center-right  okay and it's for me over the course of  that month of sweet crepes enter quite a  bit yeah yeah well I mean I mean that  route this really goes on I'm not  putting babies down I'm saying women any  doctor will tell you women aren't  tougher in a fist fight but women  gunshot wounds stab wounds starving  starving  any to poison it takes more poison to  kill a woman so women are as babies are  tougher okay and so I have daughters and  sons so I know the difference in in in  in female evolution versus male  evolution my daughter's they talked  sooner they walked sooner they were  potty-trained  sooner now once they get to be about I  say seven eight you know I mean it kind  of balances out a little bit you know me  based on how much time effort and energy  you've put into like you know what they  consume exactly but I'm saying if you've  got a white baby a brown baby a black  baby right you don't want to get before  I'd but if but but if they're a boy you  sure as hell don't want to give them to  them because how can you not give it to  them if that's the water just coming out  of you've gotta the filter it and it's  gonna be the proper type but just I  swear to god we considered how about why  speaking of babies yep  speaking of babies this is something  that's very very near and dear to me and  my concerns and things that I'm very  very very passionate about Vasa Nations  oh okay Vasa Nations what's with Vasa  Nations okay okay I believe and the  science is really obviously oh you don't  believe in science  going back 600 years ago in England they  learned how if a cow had smallpox you  wanted to give it to your kids when they  were healthy and said when they were  sick because if your kids were already  had the flu or cold and got it kill him  not a person at the time but if you gave  them smallpox on a toothpick to they  poked the pus and they'd stick it in  your arm you get a scar and most the  time you live you only died like three  percent of the time what yeah no I don't  want my baby having nothing to cause in  the doubt 1% of what you do I'm not  defending it I'm the guy that they try  to ban for saying this the inserts on  vaccines say they don't protect you and  they say they can kill you not the  factsheet if you gotta act for the ins  that comes in the package I'm getting  chills it so important my mom almost  died taking a flu shot my uncle almost  died taking a tetanus shot and they have  a secret vaccine fund speaking of Regan  this happened on the Regan where they  pay people off secretly if so many  millions were getting damaged from it my  grandmother who just died two years ago  at 92 she got a second round of polio  shots in 1955 and the doctor told her  you got polio and it almost killed her  from the vaccine so you're damn right we  have a government with a history of  objecting people with syphilis we in  vaccines absolutely why are we now gonna  trust them when they tell us that this  is great I don't people in the military  yeah where they had certain units when I  gave them the anthrax shots where people  died in almost every unit from the so  called anthrax shot so this is secret  government experimentation going on it's  not that it's not that vaccine science  is it real is it they're side effects  and they're jacking it with stuff and  90% of our vaccines are making comments  China I'm gonna tell you two things I'm  gonna tell you two things  that I find hard to believe about  vaccines or that confuse me about  vaccines first if the vaccines work and  my child haven't been vaccinated and  it's a classroom full of children that  have been vaccinated  why the hell does your kid gotta take it  we have to have a vaccine  why is my kid threatened to not be  admitted into class because he or she  doesn't have a vet seen if the other  children do have that scenes and the  vaccines actually work by the way you  just said it and I interrupted you say  it again if my child hadn't had a  vaccine but this vaccine works 100% of  the time it's safe and effective then  all these other kids are protected how  are they saying my kids bad and gonna  make their kids sick supposedly they're  protected because the truth is the flu  shots never been correct they've never  guessed the next year's mutation and if  you look at the studies taking one flu  shot doubles your chances Canadian study  for by the government 2008 doubles your  chance to take in the flu shot doubles  your chances of get  the flu the next year it's BS he lowers  your immunity and you can't trust these  companies this is true  and speaking of companies uh you know  Purdue Purdue who produces oxycontin and  like one of the largest distributors of  opioids and in this country which is  also one of the largest contributors of  the open the opioid epidemic they were  being sued they're being sued by two  thousand plus people victims that have  been affected by the drug and I believe  they were said to have been in  conversations to settle in the tune of  twelve billion now why is it that I just  hear that Purdue is looking to file  bankruptcy could you tell the people  what the strategy may be for that and  the impact it may have on the American  public  well sure what happens is once these  companies know they're about to lose  lawsuits they declare bankruptcy so that  they don't have to pay out all the money  so the people who actually did it get  away with it and a lot of those  companies their own documents will come  out their business plan is to make a new  more addictive opioid to beat all the  others and then they think by the time  that ever happens they'll just declare  bankruptcy and already moved it over  into other companies so I think you do  the answer yeah absolutely if you're  gonna tell the truth  know the truth I'm not saying I just  want does that mean you know we're  getting to know each other but  everything I mean I'm trying to be  truthful here absolutely and so I'll  give you that that actually some of the  things Trump has said I've been divisive  and and that was yeah I was just you get  so used to being attacked because I've  supported Trump he's just very affinity  but you know nobody's perfect and I  agree right is right in Rome to the left  of this  [Music] ",1
510,"Flat Earth clues part 3 the mapmakers this is part of a series of clues that can help you get your head around both the design of the Flat Earth system we live in and who has been involved in the deception to hide it from you this clue looks into the USGS otherwise known as the map makers of the world and a few surprising things that they and others have in common with the Flat Earth idea all the reference links are provided in the description below and I encourage you to check them out for those of you outside the United States usgs stands for United States Geological Survey a scientific branch of the US government formed in 1879 and with the help of the ever-expanding American Empire they quickly became the premier map makers of the known world currently they have around 9,000 employees and an annual budget of over a billion dollars a year they also have extensive science departments covering biology geography geology hydrology and many programs tied to them their motto since the 1990s has been science for a changing world I'm going to show you how true that really is what does this large really boring government group have to do with the Flat Earth to understand that you have to look into their origins which is in geography to do this you'll need to open another page that specializes in maps the maps you see in this video are from Wikipedia but there are others you can reference as well the wiki list of map projections isn't much to look at as a whole although there are a number of interesting takes in the world view not only do they have just about every perspective when it comes to the land we live on but some detailed information on where the map originated including name type the origin or creator and the year the map perspective was proposed now some of these will be very familiar especially the ones that you would see on your classroom wall there are a number of variations here but the one that has been debated on recently would be this one the galls Peters which accurately shows the size difference between the continents the most obvious clue being that the white continent of Greenland is actually tiny compared to Africa but I digress if you keep going down through all the different shapes you'll get into circular maps but only one of these is a top-down perspective that shows the continents in the center surrounded by an unbroken Ring of ice in wiki it's called the azimuthal equidistant and just to make it easier I'm going to abbreviate and call it a e for short why is this map so interesting well if you're looking at the wiki page you'll spot a few reasons the first is that in the notes section of the map and I quote used by the USGS in the National atlas of the United States it also mentions that it is used as the emblem of the United Nations of all the maps on this screen it is the only one that references a group of any kind and if you keep this page open and navigate over to the Flat Earth section of wiki you'll notice towards the bottom of the page a similar map I've referenced it here and you can tell quite easily it's identical but not referenced or link as the AE model to make things even more strange we go back to the USGS model and you see that it was first proposed a thousand years ago and you may think well that's a bad link so you compare it with the person who proposed it and you get this guy al biruni who was al biruni while he lived around a thousand years ago it was considered one of the greatest scholars of his era schooled in multiple Sciences have you ever heard of him I hadn't maybe it's multiple bad references in wiki well no because NASA knows who he is and named this moon crater after him so why is the usgs using a version of the world map designed by a thousand year old persian scientist because it's correct that's why so to be clear let's compare them again the United Nations flag the USGS official map of the earth and the Flat Earth model all identical but one isn't recognized and instead ridiculed as an outdated look at the world and this is one of those political quandary x' that the authority gets stuck in the short version is this the government is on the same page as the Flat Earth but they can't admit it even in confidence we know the earth isn't flat they say but it really is we know you use the same map as we do but ours is just an image and anyone who says differently is obviously crazy it makes you wonder how long the usgs has been using that model as an official reference the United Nations started using it for their logos in 1945 and then made some final adjustments in 1947 and the UN flag also raises a few questions like why isn't Antarctica represented on the map is it supposed to be assumed in the outer circle or perhaps the spiky olive branches on the outside they don't mention it anywhere online and this is what I like to focus on the gaps the holes in the plot the unanswered questions the USGS using the same map as the Flat Earth but not saying why not recognizing it or that you can't link the very same image from the Flat Earth wiki back to the actual AE definition of the projection the authority figured out in the 1950s all the borders of our enclosed world and have done a great job hiding it over the decades but the world is a complex place and there are clues out there just lying around I think it's time you saw some of them so do some of your own research that ask questions please feel free to email me at em sergeant 23 at Comcast net or three oh three four nine four six six three one ",1
162,all right so 911 fear-mongering if they can make everybody afraid we get everybody have to trust the government it's just one step in their plan world domination to make them to make everyone trust them a lot of people still think 911 was enacted to start the iraq war that's not really part of it because iraq iran saudi arabia pakistan they were involved i believe it was like the saudi arabian i don't know like council like a hyatt like president i got the iraq president i'm not sure i'm getting my country's mixed up but just bear with me is why i never make videos on this because little details come and go he was in washington dc the day of 9 11. and osama bin laden saddam hussein osama bin laden's family was given refuge and one of the pilots came forward later and said i'm a student i'm alive the pilot i i'm alive i'm not dead i'm here i've never been a terrorist i don't understand why this why they picked me why this happened so you know on the same day there were other drills for buildings being hit by airplanes or drills for other buildings being hit by airplanes people at the fsa we're told we're doing a bunch of drills today airplanes hitting buildings so you know just be aware of that be be advised that there will be fake airplanes hitting uh buildings boston chicago la detroit it happened everywhere that's why there were so that's why there was so much confusion that's why they couldn't intervene because they were warned ahead of time another thing is on the day of 9 11 there were more absences from work than ever before most of them being high up ceos just happened to go on emergency family vacations like the day before going out of the country which is which is really [ __ ] up and they sacrificed all these american lives because it's one thing to make a threat and say oh there's a threat and scare the american people into believing you but if you really if the terrorists really kill 3 000 people and just demolish two huge buildings that's a reason to be afraid that's a reason to turn and say who can save us what are we going to do as a people we're scared who can save us ah your government steps in and saves the day but now there's going gonna be half there's gonna have to be a lot of security measures we're gonna have to look in your bags we're gonna have to see what you have all the time look in your shoes no liquids on airplanes honestly if you read the 9 11 commission report there's a really telling amount of inconsistencies i'm brushing my teeth because i'm a good person i had these thoughts while i was brushing my teeth i'm not gonna stop brushing my teeth and you know what it's caused a hell of a lot of anxiety for the american people if you watch interviews after 9 11 terror terror terrorists terrorists terrorists terrorists terrorists terrorists terrorists terror terror terrorists terrorists they repeat that word so much and one of the best techniques of like brainwashing literally is repetition um at that there's no one after us i mean there are people that you know would love to engage in war with the with america but i mean explain to me why out of nowhere on 9-1-1 day they like they would come and attack us and even think about flying a plane into a skyscraper there's major reinforcements on skyscrapers how do you think i mean they've made them so safe and like people just ignore the jet fuel can't melt steel beams they just ignore that fact because i understand you're comfortable believing what happened it's a big thing of pride to denounce 9 11. but pretty much everyone in my generation knows that it's fake to the point that it's a joke to the point that it's literally a joke jet fuel burning temperature jeff wheel is a pair it has an auto ignition temperature of 410 degrees fahrenheit steel melting point steel melts at a temperature it's a four digit and there's different types of steel alloys yeah the melting point of stainless steel is 2550 to 2790 degrees uh let's see melting points of a low steel alloy which is 2 610 fahrenheit lead has a melting point of 621 degrees aluminum melts at 1200 18 degrees so it's not even close it's not even close it's uh it's hundreds thousands of degrees off um so that's that's a major i mean that in and of itself says a lot and i searched really hard i tried to find a lot of um i tried really hard to find videos of other skyscrapers being hit by airplanes which i know has happened which i know is something that has to happen before it the world trade center was hit by an airplane i believe in the 50s or the 40s now the world trade center i'm at the empire state building was hit by a plane and here's the thing about skyscrapers and planes um when a plane hits a skyscraper skyscrapers are reinforced i'm doing research in the moment number of steel beams world trade center facts and figures let's see so there were 110 stories in each tower 1360 something both of them feet in height let's see 50 000 people work there 200 000 tons of steel used in the construction of the world trade center 425 000 cubic yards of concrete used let's see a few foundations miles of eating cups of coffee fun fact 30 000 cups of coffee served each day 17 babies born at the world trade center i want construction i want to find the information on the steel beams that's that's what i want all right let's find it these uh multiple different grids of steel were used in the construction 12 in fact now i'm using science.howstuffworks.com um i guess i will make a little bibliography so these grades begin at a very common type of steel known as a36 which has a strength of 300 or kilo pounds per square inch that's a lot that's 30 that's 36 kilo pounds per square inch and they got progressively stronger all the way up to steels that had yield strengths of 100 kilopounds per square inch this is from the sources fema so a36 steel which is a mix of carbon and iron like all steels can handle 36 000 pounds per square inch of pressure before it begins to deform um so in the lower levels the thickness of the external walls was around four inches at higher floors it could be as thin as one quarter of an inch the construction of the floors themselves a mix of a36 steel so that strong one 36 and astm a 242 steel was used so astm a 242 is what is known as a high strength low alloy steel which means it was extra strong allowing less of it to be used which makes for lighter building so overall 200 000 tons of steel were used to build what were at the time of their construction the largest buildings on earth source ross something someone named ross it's here i'm putting the link in the description so now it says let's find out what happened all that steel so one of the most consistently used facts by 9 11 conspiracy theorists is that the grade of steel used in the world trade center simply couldn't melt at the temperatures fires created when jetliners slammed into the structures and they're right steel's melting point is 2 750 degrees fahrenheit yet jet fuel only burns between 800 and 1500 degrees fahrenheit so what happened on that september morning that caused the towers to collapse it says the steel bent even though the girders that comprise the towers wouldn't turn to molten steel in the jet fuel fire they did weaken in the heat in fact it says they could have lost half their strength also no the other items in the building were on fire um so according to the national institute of standards and technology or the nsi nist the nist even these fires combined with the impact of the planes would not have been enough to bring the buildings down their their official report concluded that the real culprit was the fact that fire proofing materials were dislodged during the impact and this in turn exposed vital structural components to the heat as these components lost strength the floors began to sag pulling the weakened columns inward and leading to a chain reaction that a floor collapsing upon floor until the buildings no longer stood and the 911 collapse these buildings fell at free fall speed i believe it takes i think i saw this somewhere it takes like 13 seconds to drop a penny off the world trade center or like 15 seconds the buildings collapsed in i think 11 seconds with literally 200 000 metric tons just of steel let alone all the concrete all the wood all the on the all the the desks the the people all that weight it collapsed at free fall speed that's not natural uh that's that's what a controlled demolition is um the other thing is when it fell it was obliterated to dust dust uh one of the firefighters said the only the biggest piece of debris he found was a phone handle um yes i know there were tons of steel and concrete that collapsed and crushed things below but all these things were found and then one completely unscathed intact passport coincidentally of one of the hijackers another development on saturday new york officials revealed at a news conference here in the city that a hijacker's passport was found blocks from the world trade center crash site if you can believe that no other details were given but the discovery prompted the fbi and police to expand their the search area down in lower manhattan so why didn't that burn in the fire why you know what i mean why was that right on top of the rubble it's interesting once you start opening your mind to the fact that people can lie to you and it's pretty easy because we want we want to trust our leaders that's our instinct is to trust the leaders but and i'm not too far in like i'm not like i think flat earth is the stupidest thing i've ever heard mostly because um i'm a very spiritual person and i've connected with the earth you know if you haven't gone out and connected with the earth before and felt the vibrations and you know drew energy and exchanged energy hey you're missing out b you can't be fully awake if you're not spiritually connected um so i think flat earth is stupid like the fact that there are mirages out at sea like where the like the boats look like they're floating in air i believe that that actually comes from the curvature of the earth and bending and like the light fractals like bending around and you know i see planets you know and there are consistencies there's constellations and a flat earth isn't real then astrology is not real um and i believe in that i believe that you know the planets and the stars we are connected to the universe you know if even one person didn't exist or one thing happened differently than it did this universe wouldn't exist so we're literally all one uh young pharaoh wisely said you know our brains are like computers and our mind is like the internet because everyone connects on a mind level you know you can be like oh people just talk to each other but that in and of itself is connecting on a mind level to be able to think and process the greeting you want to give someone and then and having them understand it and return it that's literally working on the same network of mines like the same network of neurons and when you break it down we're actually all made of atoms and molecules we're all made of the same [ __ ] so we literally are just part of one big growing evolving adapting system you know so energy can neither be created nor destroyed and it's a proven fact that there's that there is a spirit that there is a part of consciousness that science can't explain with just experiments and test tubes and measurements and [ __ ] it's the kites consciousness and we all share that even plants and animals i mean it's proven if you speak kindly to plants they will grow and they will blossom and flourish and if you yell at plants they respond negatively these are all just things that i've learned over time and my mom and my sister have been like why don't you make videos about this and i get nervous because what if i miss a piece of information what if i say something wrong and like people come at me i don't like confrontation but i think it's about time people understand you know people are going to come at me and say well where's your proof where's your evidence i mean watch a couple documentaries you know i in a way i'm communicating to people who don't believe this but there's also there are also people that already do know these things that i'm just communicating with in the sense that we both know what's happening we are both existing on the same plane of knowledge um and understanding so you have to understand you have to understand that you're you've all in america for example you've already been conditioned to believe lies um christopher columbus i'm reading about this now christopher columbus was upheld as this amazing figure this american hero uh yeah he didn't discover america you can't you can't discover a place right you can't be the original pioneer discoverer of a place if there's already people living there you see and there were so many americans already here native americans tens of millions of them and when he went down to south america he i mean he enslaved so many native americans there were 10 million that he had and by the end um by the end there was like 12 000 i think or some ridiculous number like that um and he sex trafficked the girls he said you know have your pick basically have your pick a fresh young [ __ ] and by young i mean in his travel locks he kept very kept meticulous logs they had ship logs that they would keep because they didn't have electronics so they would follow the stars and in order to follow the stars on a cloudy night you can't see the stars so you have to look at your star log your ship log and kind of guess guess where you are based on where you were the night before and where you were the night before and the way the winds were blowing yesterday and you know the temperature and this and that and you know so he was he was actually really good at keeping track of stuff so when he wrote um something about young native girls um like especially look out for the nines and tens and i'm pretty sure back in the day they didn't rate girls on a scale of one to ten like they do now so nines and tens to me pretty much translates to disgusting pedophilia and it's horrific because these people were living here they were already here and when columbus and his people showed up they were kind you know they they welcomed them in they taught them how to farm they they taught them what to do and they brought them in and they welcomed them and they just turned around and made them slaves and it's it's always been a thing to make people with darker skinned slaves i mean even like but back in the day slavery was like a thing that people did it's just true europeans enslaved europeans africans enslaved africans people traveled and enslaved other people it's horrible but it was something that was common so in a way you got to look at columbus and be like this is something that he was around but at the other same times de soto was speaking out all the time about how slavery was wrong and slavery was an abomination and columbus was an abomination for having slaves but we walk around and we uphold columbus as this pioneer who discovered our country what he did i mean they brought diseases over to these people who had lived off the land and lived naturally and had spiritual connections with the earth and the animals and like part of me thinks that's like so gross like these dirty diseased nasty i'm not a hater on white people but like these gross like crusty white people like came over and like infected everybody that that says something about what like their health like it says something about like you like ew like what hygiene they had that's just so disgusting to me and like we adopted some of native american culture for sure but also we demolished it and there are still true native americans living here on reservations and they're still getting treated like [ __ ] and it sucks and i wonder what i can do to stop it other than just educate people um but i know columbus would chop people's hands off native americans he would it wasn't just he enslaved them and then if they disobeyed he killed them like he would torture them he would cut their noses and ears off if they disobeyed or they didn't do something right to send messages to their tribes take their women rape them sell them to other people and there's so many different tribes i mean he just swept the land and just killed literally millions of people so that means like over a couple years so like that's literally like hundreds of people dying a day right or is that thousands of people dying a day because the other thing is he took them from a natural like a natural place like a natural diet their lifestyle and he would like hold them up and like put them on boats and ships and he like would bring them back to england and they would they would starve and they'd go into malnutrition and they'd develop really bad health and they would get these diseases at these nasty gross dirty europeans had so it's really a whole mess so my point is if you're and this is true these are what now this i'm reading lies my teacher told me by [ __ ] i'll put it in there it's by someone and this is a really educational book um because this guy is a history professor and he actually read a total of the first edition he read 12 different history textbooks for i guess high schoolers um and he compared it to real history and only a few of them you know even mentioned that columbus had slaves um and it's like these history companies are supposed to tell you that the real history and they don't and you have to question why do they choose to leave out the truth why they write history like it's a like it's a book like like oh it's tough but you always know there's gonna be a good end like that's just not how it was history you have to and they also don't teach critical thinking so the questions that they ask at the end of the chapter are like why did columbus go on his expedition but they should be questions like like what like what urged columbus to go on his expeditions like why like do you think these were right like do you really think that he made it to a minute like i don't know but like they should be more critical thinking questions that challenge the students to question history and put their own opinions on it instead of just answering like where did he go who did he what did he see like all these questions that you just flipped to a page and see um there should be critical thinking questions so my point is my point [ __ ] is if they are lying to you about who founded this country and the the most basic facts of this country did the cat get out it's a rat how did the rack get out outdoors come here bobby if they can [ __ ] lie to you about how this country was founded and the kind of people that claimed this land that's the very beginning if it starts on a lie what stops them from continuing to lie because the problem is these past couple years we've been catching them in lie after lie after lie sex trafficking rings collusions with china joe biden and his son while he was vice president inviting the chinese consulate to the pentagon and to like little rooms in the white house at midnight look that up why you know what why lie if you're not doing anything wrong why lie why like that's a great example if you're not doing anything wrong then why not be open why didn't trump show us his tax records because me i'd be like yeah look at them even if i was five i'd be like yeah i [ __ ] up i lied you could get out of it you're trump my other question is why didn't obama show us his birth certificate and people claim like that's like racist so he shouldn't have to okay but there are claims that he wasn't born here which i don't care about i think you know he's he's a demon but all presidents are awful people it's all planned they're all part of the thing actually a lot of presidents aren't even invited to the bilderberg group meetings um which says a lot about where the power really lies because it's a place where decisions are made are made for the world the us president is supposed to be the most powerful person in the world he doesn't even get invited i know bill clinton wasn't bill clinton's a [ __ ] brainwashed puppy it's all hillary seriously it's all hillary straight up these aren't just conspiracy theories i'm serious look at this rat hey baby don't do that don't do that don't do that you're gonna you're gonna fall here so that's where i'm at um yeah i'm currently handling i'm currently handling the distro i think that's all i wanted to say a minute ago ,1
446,according to a report in WorldNetDaily some of the richest men and women in the world met secretly in New York recently when the world's wealthiest individuals hold secret meetings it's time to pay attention in 1910 the six wealthiest men in the world met a Jekyll Island Georgia that meeting resulted in the creation three years later of the largest criminal enterprise ever devised the Federal Reserve so-called judging from the list of participants the recent meeting in New York may result in something even more monumental the London Times identified them as Bill Gates David Rockefeller Ted Turner Oprah Winfrey Warren Buffett George Soros and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg based on the Forbes magazine list of billionaires the room had a net worth of about a hundred and twenty billion dollars with all the bailout figures we've heard recently that doesn't sound like that much believe me it is a hundred and twenty billion dollars is about equal to the annual budget for all of New York State from New York City to Buffalo and everything in between the meeting which took place in early May was at the home of Sir Paul nurse a British Nobel Prize winning biochemist and president of Rockefeller University Microsoft founder Bill Gates called a meeting the London Times reported the informal afternoon session was so discreet that some of the billionaires aides were told they were at security briefings discreet is the British Way of saying secret I do not believe that is coincidental that this meeting came only a couple of weeks after another super secret and more powerful group met in the secrecy in Greece the Bilderberg Group they have advocated a one-world government for at least a century they also see themselves as the elite saviors of mankind according to The Times the billionaires were each given 15 minutes to present their favorite cause over dinner they discussed how they might settle on an umbrella cause that can harness their interest taking their cue from gates the report said they agreed that population control was the number one issue experts say the global population will top 7 billion in 2012 according to reports at the meeting Bill Gates outlined a plan to cap the global population at eight point three billion it all sounds so civilized doesn't it here's the less politically correct but more accurate version a group of unelected liberals with more money than many governments have just decided how many people will be permitted to live this group of self-appointed governors will now have to draw up criteria to be used to decide who will not be permitted to live and how they will die it can and will be dressed up in polite in civil terms but in the end it means certain people will have to die the meeting was billed as a meeting of philanthropists wanting to do good but one can put lipstick and pearls on a pig it'll still be a pig and the final analysis there's only way one way to cap a population by deciding who's permitted to live and who for the good of all must die ,1
176,"You So everybody When I never met in person I never met Jordan Peterson in person But I said to him when we met right before lunch Something that I said to me by so many people who meet me for the first time. I feel like I know you and I that is the highest compliment in in effect I now understand what a compliment that is what I receive it because I never gave it to somebody before you and I I have watched you for hours and listen To you and read your book and in fact, I didn't just read your book. I heard your book from you so I want to tell you something without embarrassing you, but I think I I'd like to you open your heart and your mind and so do I? When I was very young I realized that God or nature had given me What I have called a goodness detector And I knew I always knew when I was in the presence of a good person Because that's all I really care about. I think brains are wildly overrated wildly That's why I think you're not bright if you join Mensa Why you would want to announce to the world your IQ is so bizarre to me that I I'm sure there are nice people there, but I I don't understand it, but I always picked up That and I've and I've always been right it's a it's a I'm batting a thousand essentially and When I heard you read your book the passion comes from I just want to help people lead a better life and It's really it's it's quite overwhelming you you didn't just read that book you Won't say you sang it but I like that you use music. I'm very much into music, too so this is the man that I'm Honored to have this dialogue with because you're out everybody knows you're bright But I know you're good So I want them to take that at the outset. I Was something to say about that good that's good See I don't think it's true I mean, this is why I Got motivated to do what I've been doing and I've been doing what I've been doing for. I would say since about 1979 In one form or another because things take a long time to generate and one of the things I learned in the early 80s was that People have a great capacity for evil and I didn't really understand that of myself until The early eighties something like that after meditating on it for a long time and So I would say It's not that done I would never claim to be good. I think it's dangerous But I did become terrified of how terrible I could be And I mean, I became terrified about how terrible human beings could be and that's one thing but that's easy It's easy to confuse that with other human beings You know, it's a different thing to Understand that it's true of yourself. I often recommend to my students that they read history as a perpetrator and not as a victim or a hero and People very seldom do that and it's no wonder But I would say perhaps that I became terrified enough from learning what I learned that I tried to Avoid the pathways that lead people to the dark places that they go And there's something in that that might approximate good Yeah, it does approximate good III I I would agree with that The parallels between Us are so eerie to me that in my book on happiness, which came out of 99. I Actually have a chapter on the necessity of having a tragic view of life and then I hear you speak of light just now this tragic view of life and Ironically if you don't have that you can't be happy so it's just another example of This in that you're getting this message out if you want to comment on that, please if not I'll go on I you you you are such an I watch you and you're such an intense listener I don't know when you're gonna react so There's this old idea You know you all know this idea It's an idea that's Expressed for example in the classic Disney movie classic Disney movie which I really like called Pinocchio and you know when Pinocchio is attempting to free himself from the forces that manipulate him as a puppet and to become an autonomous being He is required to go to the darkest place To find the worst Catastrophes that Voluntarily and in doing so he rescues his father. That's a very old idea I Don't know how old it is it it's It's one of the oldest ideas we have in written form and and there's no doubt that in its pre written form it would be tens of thousands of years older than that and it's a very strange idea that you have to Journey to the darkest abyss to free the spirit of your father But there's a reason for it and it has to do with the tragic view of life Which is that you can't discover What you're capable of? Being or withstanding and and those are the same things Without if you hide away from any of the things about life that are terrible but true and and and the reason you can't discover Who you are? without doing that is that only necessity will force that out of you and and it I mean that I mean that From the perspective of learning if you go work in a palliative care award. You'll learn to deal with death you'll learn that this psychological strategies necessary the Steps you'll become more informed but it's deeper than that. Even we know now from a biological perspective that If you put yourself in new situations in new and challenging situations That new genes turn on in your nervous system and code for new proteins that produce new neurological structures And so you can't even be what you are fully biologically unless you expose yourself to everything that you can expose yourself to as you journey through life the old idea of a Pilgrimage was predicated on on that idea as is walking the Shark Cathedral the the labyrinth The idea that you walk the labyrinth in in Chartres and you come to the center is that you traverse every corner of the world quarter by quarter, and then you come to the center and The center is the center of the church and it's the center of the crucifixion. It's the center of suffering and You can't get to what that Center Signifies without having journeyed everywhere and so The tragic view of life is necessary Because it puts you on the journey that reveals to yourself who you could be if you were courageous as courageous as you could be and as truthful as you could be and that's equivalent to discovering 2/3 vivifying your dead father because you Are an ancient creature in some sense and and perhaps one with a spark of divinity Inherent in it, but you will never release that Unless you're willing to go everywhere that you have to go because only necessity will call that out of you and so you can't be Happy You can't be complete without You can't know what you could withstand. You can't have any proper sense of self-respect unless you know what you can tolerate and if you avoid Everything that you have reason to avoid but should nonetheless not avoid you won't know who you are and then you can't live properly So you you have said on a number of occasions and in every on every occasion that I have watched you say it Not a single person in the panel you often talk on panels. Not one person has ever actually reacted to it. I Totally get it Nevertheless, it's one of the most important things you regularly say you live as if there is a God Is that correct? well people ask me if I believe in God, you know, I just said I'm gonna release a Podcast about that because I answered that question for about two hours in Australia because people kept asking me about question which I really don't like I don't like that question and So I hadn't thought about it for a good while and I tried to figure out why and and then I thought well He said you believe you see I thought who would have the audacity to claim That they believed in God if They examined the way they lived Who would dare say that? To to believe you think to believe in a Christian Actually, this is why Nietzsche said there was only ever one Christian and that was Christ To have the audacity to claim that means that you live it out fully and That's an that's an unbearable Task in some sense. I just debated to Tsavo Asia About a week ago, although it wasn't really much of a debate It was it was a strange event But he said something very brilliant and to me that justified the entire event at least from my perspective He talked about Christ's moment of crisis on the cross when he cried out to God that he had been Forsaken and what Dziedzic said was that what that meant was that the conditions of human existence are so tragic That even God himself in human form Lost faith for a moment in the goodness of being and I thought that was a remarkable observation because Well, if God Himself would lose faith under such conditions What would you expect from normal human beings? confronted with what we're confronted by and To be able to accept the structure of existence the suffering that goes along with it and the disappointment and the betray land and - Nonetheless act properly right to aim it the good with all your heart right - to dispense with the malevolence and your desire for destruction and revenge and all of that and to face things courageously and to tell the truth To speak the truth and to act it out. That's what it means to believe That's what it means it doesn't it doesn't mean to state it it means to act it out and Unless you act it out. You should be very careful about claiming it and so I've never been comfortable saying anything other than I try to act as if God exists because god only knows what you'd be if you truly believed I Mean if you think about it in some sense that's the central idea in Christianity is that if you were capable of believing, it would be a transfiguring event a Truly transfigure event and I know people experience that to one degree or another But we have no idea what the limit of that is we have no idea what the possibility is within each person if they lived a life that was maximally courageous and maximally truthful You know because maybe you're running that 60 percent or 70 percent or twenty percent and at cross-purposes to yourself God only knows what you'd be if you believed and so Well I act I try to act like I believe But I'd never claim that I manage it Because it's too it's it's a lot to manage properly and you have to be careful about claiming to manage things that you can't manage and so That's part of the answer to that question. It's a great answer as it happens Like you to react to something that Is very operative in my life. I just and if you I always tell people on my radio showing Totally feel free. He'd say sorry. I really don't don't find that tenable or whatever you however you want to react Am I my route as an adult to God has been completely circuitous I have come through the the back door. I Wrote 25 years ago how I found God at Columbia. I realized in the 70s at graduate school at Columbia that I was being taught nonsense literally nonsense things that made no sense and It drove me crazy because they were all bright bright people taught me nonsense One day walking through Columbia. The only time I ever had I wouldn't say I never had a theophany, but I did have an epiphany all of a sudden one of the verses from my yeshiva education in Brooklyn, New York the Cloistered Orthodox world of my childhood and I don't use cloistered and I don't like clustered But I'm not using it at a pejorative way. I'm just explaining what I had and All of a sudden one of the verses that we said every morning in kindergarten first grade and second grade For the first time since second grade came to my brain rashid lafayette other than my wisdom begins with fear of the Lord Changed my life. There's no wisdom at Columbia because there's no God at Columbia and That has been That is one of the ways I knew Oh Without God. Look what happens without God look what happens morally intellectually in terms of wisdom, and I my biggest reasons for belief in God are Watching what happens when people don't So I'd love to have your reaction If you cease to believe in God you'll start to believe in anything that Was the British tested and yet just thank you. Yeah. Well, that's that's a That's a good that's a good way of looking at it. I mean if Catholicism, you know I've gone through lots of Catholic cathedrals in Europe. And of course, they're stunning creations and but they're gothic and strange and the doctrine is eerie, and and Complex and surreal and and and the biblical writings are the same You think of a book like revelation for example But I think that the Catholicism that's as sane as people can get You know Broadly speaking is that you we need a metaphysic a narrative metaphysic to hold us together and it has to be Predicated on something that's transcendent and absolute And if you lose that then you'll fall for something else you'll fall for something else or you'll fall for nothing which is which is no better and I learned that from reading Nietzsche and I learned that from reading Dostoevsky and This is the problem with the rationalists like Sam Harrison and and and the atheists Dawkins Now they believe that if we dispensed with our superstitions, we'd all become Harris and Dawkins Rational beings Devoted towards the good However, we conceptualize that for rational reasons and I don't believe that because I don't believe that we are rational beings fundamentally I think we're deeply irrational It's amazing that we can all sit in this room together without tearing ourselves into shreds And I mean that it's really quite a remarkable thing that all of us who've come from all over North America can sit here so peacefully and concentrate on a single thing without any tension or trouble The the improbability of that should not be underestimated The the unlikelihood that that might be the case and then the issue of God as well is that there has to be something a fundamental worth There is something that you consider a fundamental worth You know what? I think that regard for other people for the consciousness of other people for the conscious being of other people is Is is in that realm if you're going to Have a relationship with yourself if you're going to be able to love someone else if you're going to be able to take care of Your family and your community you have to attribute to human beings and a value that Might as well be described as divine given that it has to be the the ultimate value that you hold and I see it seems to me that it's not unreasonable to associate that value that is Intrinsic in humanity with something. That's of Metaphysically that's metaphysically real that's part of the structure of reality itself and My sense has been that it's It makes If you watch how people act when they're acting properly the hypothesis that there is Divinity within us that reflects divinity itself is the only conclusion that makes sense that works and so I think the evidence I think the evidence suggests that You know, you said you look look what happens when societies lose their bearings. It's like Yeah you that's what convinced me to the degree that I became a religious person I didn't wasn't as if I discovered God it was more like I discovered Satan discovered the devil and certainly believed that very powerfully metaphysically or not You don't have to read that much about what happened in Nazi Germany or what happened in The Soviet Union or what happened in Mao's China what continues to happen in many places around the world? to be convinced that there's a great darkness and it seems to me that if there's a great darkness then there has to be a great light and the first part of that is True beyond any hope of refutation and The second seems to be a logical necessity in the light of the first It's a powerful line that you you know, I feel so obviously the same I want to talk to you about the darkness so I've often said all of my life really that we Have a wrong metaphor in calling evil dark because it's it's actually so bright That people can stare it in the face the number of Canadian or American students at the most prestigious universities who could identify Pol Pot or even the Gulag Archipelago Let alone the Great Leap Forward in China is so small The knowledge of evil it is now up to over a quarter of kids never heard of Auschwitz It'll be a half very silly. It will be three quarters in a generation. They don't know evil. I At Berkeley I was had a dialogue with two leftist students My last question to them was do you believe people are basically good and they said yes And I said, it's so demonstrably wrong that belief That there's only one possible explanation for why you hold it because you live in such a good country yeah, well, that's the that's the goodness of naivety right and it's something that's that's Encouraged, you know you encourage that by Producing safe spaces around people you produce that by sheltering them you want to preserve that childlike? Innocence but once you're no longer a child, it's not childlike. It's just childish And that's that's not good to be a 40 year old child and to think that people are fundamentally good. It's it's not Good is very difficult? It's by no means the default position. What's the default position entropy? Catastrophe tragedy malevolence and death that's the default position the good struggles up against that That's no easy thing to manage to think of that is intrinsic. It's an intrinsic possibility, but it's not something that you It's not something that It's not something that you can manifest without faith and commitment and and the more faith and the more commitment the better and the deeper the better and it's the most difficult of things to do and and it is It's appalling to teach people the alternative and I know that speaking I think speak of this clinically You know The people who are most prone to post-traumatic stress disorder are naive people This is well known clinically. It's there's nothing about this. That's it's it's It's questionable or for unorthodox If you believe that people are basically good and that the world rewards goodness with good in return if that's your fundamental belief that there's not really any such thing as evil and You encounter someone malevolent, which could be yourself Well, that's often what happens to people who develop post-traumatic stress disorder, you know, they're there it's very common that people develop PTSD because they've done something so incomprehensibly Morally repugnant that it's damaged them Psycho physiologically and they cannot recover. It's very common among soldiers It's not what they saw. Although sometimes it is it's what they did They have no framework within which to conceptualize it If you have no theory of evil if you have no theory of good and evil, if you have no metaphysics and someone malevolent touches you you're done and so telling people that Human beings are basically good and that evil doesn't exist makes them ripe fruit for the picking by the malevolent and There's nothing about that that's positive. It's mere Cowardice masquerading as virtue. It's the devouring mother and from the Freudian perspective. I'll keep you innocent I'll keep you young and naive and nothing will ever come to harm you it's like precisely the opposite is the case in life That is why by the way, I truly yep That is why I truly believe that a 12 year old at a traditional Christian or a Jewish school is wiser and More likely to be happy than a secular professor of philosophy who is 50 years old Just because I knew I went again to yeshiva all the so half the day in Hebrew Jewish studies have today in English secular Studies I knew at 6 people were not basically good because God said so in Genesis When he decided to destroy the world because it turned out rotten so I knew at the earliest possible age people were not basically good and it not only Affected my felt and show my worldview It made me happy because then I realized wow I'm eating good people despite the fact that people about basically good I really do it but people in my life am I lucky or what? Yeah. Yeah. Well that that's a that's a really good. That's a really good point because You see when I said that it was a miracle that we can all sit here peacefully Like that is how I look at it I think every day when I walk out into the world and it's not rack and Runes and flames and floods that it's a bloody miracle. It was I mean it that we hold this together It's not an easy thing to do and release to think of pace as the default position is a form of deep insanity like it's it requires work to do to to maintain peace and You can't be properly grateful Unless you understand how unlikely it is that? Well, we're not in the throes of World War 3. We're not still in the depths of World War 2 that the Cold War is mostly over that the economic conditions of people everywhere on the planet are improving at a rate that could only be described as miraculous and that most things are going in a positive direction if you assume that that's Normative, then you think well, that's life. But and you have no reason to to be wide-eyed To have your eyes wide open admiration and gratitude at the fact that the worst which is frequently manifested itself is not Knocking at your door at this moment Because that's the story of humanity and not peace and prosperity So here we have it and here we should preserve it and here we should spread it We should do everything we can to live in a manner that makes that most likely and we should do that Because well you said what did you say fear of God? It's like Throughout the Old Testament, you know It's one story after another is that people develop? Societies and they become arrogant and they wander off the path. And as soon as they wander off the path all hell breaks loose and If you're fortunate enough to be where all hell isn't breaking loose you should do everything you can to help ensure that we Stay the course and walk the straight and narrow path so I have a So I have a very deep worry in light of our absolute Unanimity if you could speak of unanimity among two people, but we're so consonant in this this is shocking how good things are and Yet in the United States and I follow Canada a lot but love to speak about America right now in The United States half at least half of young people think they are living in a rotten society Sexist intolerant xenophobic homophobic Islamophobic racist bigoted That's six herb. That's my acronym for what I just said this is frightening to me and I want to know is it frightening to you? Well You know, I always try to give the devil his due and the idea that the West is a oppressive patriarchy Characterized by the sins that you just described It's true You know, there's if we look through our history personal or political There's no shortage of things to be appalled by That's not the question Exactly, or that's not the issue The issue is compared to what No, I was Churchill this time I've got this right It was Churchill who said that democracy is the worst form of government except for all the other forms of government and I would say that about our societies is that There's no we have every reason to be awake and cognizant of our errors Whether they're political or economic or personal But Compared to how it could be And now it has been in many places and how it is most Everywhere in the world and how it was for much of the 20th century things are so good here that it's absolutely beyond comprehension and So along with that Careful awareness of the flaws of the patriarchy let's say should be an unbelievable gratitude that we could wake up in the morning and The lights are on and the and the the freeways are running and there's no starvation Directly facing us and that our children will live and that the probability that any one of us will die a violent death is negligible and The thing that bothers me about one of the things that bothers me about the modern University is the absolute lack of gratitude that characterizes its teachings. It's like it's half the story, you know, it's like people are oppressed by Nature and People are oppressed by culture and people are oppressed by their own dark Nate their own dark side It's an existential reality But you have to you have to balance that you have to understand that nature has its benevolent element and that's what's giving you life and you have to be grateful for your culture for everything that it's provided to you and you have to understand that people can be good as well as Adversarial and malevolent and you have to be grateful for that and there's damn there's a there's there's a There's a damnable shortage of gratitude in the modern Academy and that's based on a naivety or a resentment That's so deep that it's almost in comprehending a naivety and a resentment and a willful blindness to the reality of history That's so deep that it's almost incomprehensible So if we ask you it may be you may strike. Whose absurd I'm gonna ask it anyway Except for technical knowledge like medicine or engineering mathematics obviously any of the Natural Sciences law if nobody went if all North Americans Graduating high school decided I'm not going to college With the with North America be a better or a worse place If you took away the STEM fields Yeah taking away the STEM fields. I think that universities Not colleges necessarily. I Think that universities do more harm than good now that and I'm very loath to say that, you know because I've been Part of the Academy for thirty years and taught it great institutions but the The postmodern collectivist doctrine is so Psychologically and politically toxic That I think that Academia now does more harm than good and It's not only what it teaches which is the ideology this ungrateful ideology which denies the existence of the individual One of the things I might tell you just so you know, this is that You know that you hear that there are debates about free speech on campus About who should talk and who shouldn't and people think that's what the debate is about About who should talk and who shouldn't but that's not what the debate of it is about that You don't even scraping the surface of the debate if that's what you think. It's about The debate on campus is about whether or not a human being has the capacity to communicate intelligibly as an individual or not and the answer for the postmodernist collective types is that there is no such thing as an individual and Therefore the very notion of free speech is absurd Because free speech is predicated on the idea that each of us have something to say, that's ours That's a consequence of our unique individuality not our group identity or or the multiplicity of our group identities but something that it's something that we have that speaks from our spirit that can speak to the spirit of another and produce a negotiated peace and That's what's being debated That the war that's going on philosophically or theologically in the campuses is far deeper than you think it no the entire notion of the reality of the individual which is I think also the entire notion of The idea that human beings are made in the image of God most fundamentally That is what's being attacked. It wasn't for nothing that Derrida called Western culture FAL logo centric phallus for Masculine logos for logos for truth and courage and centric for centric that was a criticism from his perspective the idea of the sovereignty of the individual if you don't have the idea of the Sovereignty of the individual because there's no individual. There's no free. Speech All you are is an avatar of your group interests, and if I'm not in your group It's not in my interest to let you speak There's nothing that we have to say to one another there's nothing but power it's a Hobbesian nightmare of group against group and That's the postmodern doctrine and so it's to call it appalling is to barely scrape the surface it's it's an assault it is it is truly an assault on the most fundamental principles by which the West is governed it's not Surface level philosophy, it goes all the way to the bottom this is partly why I've been concentrating on religious themes in my lectures say Because the argument goes all the way down to first principles Is there is The in is the idea of the sovereignty of the individual Correct The Western answer is it's the great discovery of the West the Western answer is that's the most fundamental truth that is Exactly, what's under assault at the universities? The reason that the collectivist types hate me is Because I've got their number. I know what they're up to And I think I think further that They do not wish to shoulder the unbearable responsibility of being a sovereign individual So not only is it And That accounts for the cowardice and that accounts for the attempt to weaken the spirit of the people that they're teaching by over protecting them they're not willing to take on the responsibility and the Fault has to lie elsewhere And I think that's a good judge of someone Someone's character in general. It's like Well, the world is in the messy State. Let's say And the question is whose fault is it an answer is yours That's the right answer it's not the patriarchy it's not Some identifiable group. It's not some structure that's gone wrong, even though those things can go wrong And that's the other fundamental truth of the West is that things would be a lot better if you were a lot better and you Have to decide if you're willing to accept that and and you have every reason not to it's a terrible thought Don't With Solzhenitsyn, I think this is a paraphrase, but it's close enough he said that one person who stopped lying could bring down a tyranny and that that When I first read that I thought that can't possibly be true and as I understood it, I thought that can't possibly not be true because the only thing that can break, the spine of a tyranny is the truth and the only person that and the only Way that the truth can be told is that some individual tells it? And so it's necessarily the case that tyranny is broken by the truth of the individual But then the question is well, is it going to be you that's going to do that? It's no trivial thing, you know people come and tell me Very frequently and they write me and they say well, you know I agree with what you say and this terrible thing is happening in my workplace And you know, I don't know what to do about it And I don't want you to make my story public and because of the potential for repercussions and I think yeah Well, I mean, I understand your position. It's no joke - it's no joke - stand up when when when When the when the amateur totalitarians are knocking on your office door But if you don't then sooner sooner than you think it'll be the professional Totalitarians and then you'll be in this sort of trouble that that unless you've tried to imagine it you can't possibly imagine so in the minutes remaining I'm gonna ask you a few personal questions As I did with the late great Charles Krauthammer at one of our weekend's Because people like including me just fascinated belicus. So here's one What was the city in Alberta you grew up in? Well, it wasn't a city exactly. Okay little town It's called Fairview It's about 800 miles north of the American border. So it's a long ways up there. Right so How often if at all that do you think? when people stop you at airports and you go around the world lecturing Jordan Peterson from Fairview It's hard to believe Does that happen? Well, I live I live in a constant state of disbelief I mean I'm dead serious about this like I think it's a form of post-traumatic Post-traumatic shock in some sense. I mean my life in the last three years has been just a continuous series of surreal Impossibilities. I mean on the one hand I've been involved in a political scandal of some sort For a good year and a half. It was at least twice a week And then for the entire three year period it's been at least once a week. It's nonstop and sometimes it's national and sometimes it's international but it's continual and so that's I'll give you an example. This is a funny little story my son came over one day about year-and-a-half ago And I was having a kind of a rough day because 200 of my colleagues at the University had signed a document trying to get me fired and Then they gave it to the Union and and the Union presented it to the administration without even informing me Even though I'm part of the faculty union, and so I said to my son Julian you know 200 of my colleagues today just signed a letter saying that I should be fired and he said oh Dad, don't don't worry about that. It was only 200 And I thought well that's where we were out, you know, it was like, oh that's not that's nuts That's a that was a light day I was ok, you know And then so there's that and and the fact that it doesn't quit. That's another thing. I can't understand it's like, you know all this blew up around me around Bill c16 and I thought well, I've had my 15 minutes or mine then it was like well, I've had my week and then it was like oh I must have had my month and then but none of that happened it just kept expanding and expanding and expanding and expanding and expanding and and every day I wake up and I think well this is gonna come to an end, but it doesn't it just expands and and that just doesn't seem credible in the least every time I come to an event like this or I mean when I was in Australia I was speaking to audiences of 5,500 people and it's like how in the world can you believe that it's like I you heard what I just said who there who in their right mind would come and listen to someone who just told you what I told you you know, it's so dark and it's so demanding you wouldn't think that people would Line for blocks and spend their hard-earned money and and come because it's a like a marital anniversary That's what they say. This was our anniversary present to each other. I thank you people you my you're completely out of your mind And so and then I think to you know that that That the state of disbelief is necessary and maybe that's an advantage to being older Because I'm too old to adapt rapidly and this isn't the sort of thing that you should adapt to right I should be in a constant state of shock disbelief because it keeps my head on straight. I Don't know what's going on. Exactly. I don't know why it's the case that what I'm saying is so necessary Apparently but it seems to be and I'm trying to figure out why But I'm certainly not for a second. I think I take very little for granted And I mean, I think I take even less for granted than you might think I told you that I don't take it for granted that you can all sit here peacefully, you know and And that is how I look at the world is that if it isn't if it isn't burning in rock and runes then I think it's a bloody miracle and the fact that things have gone well for me and That I'm still standing which is also a miracle of sorts, you know, I mean There were probably 30 different scandalous Episodes that had every that anyone with any sense would have thought would finish me and They've all backfired and that's all so I Also don't understand that It's like I don't understand that I get attacked in new york times and my friends Call me who are New York Times readers and they say You you you you've had it this time cuz that was the New York Times, you know You're not gonna recover from that and I think well, that's probably true I mean I was expecting it to happen all along and then I wait and then you know everybody clamors out me and then I don't respond too much to that and it starts to die away and then all the supporters come out and then there's a Hundred people who clamor and ten thousand supporters and you know, here's something I can tell you about my life That's really remarkable so, you know if you just Read the press Well, you'd have all sorts of ideas about me. I mean You know that I'm a bigot in the broadest possible sense. And so that's you know racist sexist homophobic Ethnocentric white nationalists. All right All of those things And you'd think that there was just nothing but hatred Although I have been treated well by many journalists But you you could easily get that sense that like I live in a world Where I'm surrounded by hatred and that is absolutely not true it's so not true that that that it's You know There are lies and then there are there are there are anti truths then and an anti truth is even worse than a lie It's like the ultimate form of lie, and that is what my life is like at all what my life is like is that I Travel with my wife and wherever we go. And I mean that literally wherever we go We've been to I don't know how many countries in the last year. It's like I Don't know how many 30 40 many countries If I go down the street nor if I'm in an airport, or if I'm in a cafe or if I'm in a movie theater, or if I'm in a mechanic's shop Some person comes up to me every 10 minutes and says I hope I'm not disturbing you and they're very very polite and they say I've been listening to your lectures or I've been watching your YouTube videos or I read your book and I was in this dreadful place six months ago and then they tell me a little bit about the particulars of that little corner of hell they were in sconce tin and then they say Well, I've been trying to develop a vision for my life or I've been trying to take more responsibility Are being trying to be grateful for my job Mundane though it may be or I've decided that I'm going to try to put my family together and make peace and I've really been trying and it's really working and things are way better and Thank you And so Well, it's so overwhelming to have that happen. Continually. It's very difficult to believe but It's unbelievably positive You know, I mean it's if you could imagine if you could ask for what you want today. You could have anything you wanted You might think It would be lovely if I could give my life in a manner so that wherever I went in the world Perfect strangers would come up to me one after the other and tell me that They're suffering much less That their families are in better shape and that their lives are on course because they took They they took to heart some something that I was communicating That's as good as it gets as far as I could I Had really I don't want to ask anything else I think this was so powerful and if that didn't prove my instinct is right Nothing will Georgie Peterson You are a good man. You are doing a lot of good. I thank God he made you Thank you You",1
228,welcome to truth or tube it's uh march 17 2021 this is mad a and mystic sky watcher all right guys it's uh valentine's i'm not valentine's saint patty's day i'm surely been sprayed with lots of chemtrails lately so i'm heavy on it trying to explain to you guys why i'm so foggy enjoying my irish cream liquor drink while i uh show you some interesting things that i found today so let's play this video by john boy what's happening folks what's going on here i know do you guys know do you want to spread the word i spread this video on my twitter feed this is by john boyce channel so i'll show you his channel john boy oh why am i not subscribed maybe i'm on a different account right now all right here we go what's happening folks let's put genocide [Music] [Music] ah [Music] very disturbing because i decided to go research [Music] on google and yahoo find out what was going in inside these nasty trails being laid on humanity that's why i wanted to come out here and show you guys what i found the scrub of truth versus telling people the facts now this has been happening in all our skies here in north america and the united kingdom and australia that i can tell you because i watch it all the time now this week has been like this year this is in tennessee this was on the 15th of march 2021 [Music] [Music] now there's a disinformation campaign pain going on on google because if you do a search for what's going on what they're spraying out onto us you will see when i show you in a minute that they're trying to cover up and make it look like we're conspiracy theorists talking about contrails when you go to yahoo search it'll tell you straight up the facts that's the difference and i want to show you because google has been scrubbing things for many years now including silver iodide that does and what they do with the cloud seating with that [Music] very disturbing very disturbing this is so disturbing to me [Music] man look at the spider web they're creating total spider web full of heavy metals strontium 90 aluminum and barium [Music] with polymers so you're breathing that in and it's creating all kinds of problems with our systems and all of nature look at those uh hawks flying in it all right one more thing it focuses on rebuilding the backbone of this country working families the middle class oh boy yeah the devil's in the details that's what he said on that one all right the devil's in the details because listen here this is the research i was looking at earlier let me show you so if you type in chemicals in chemtrails google search this is what comes up okay what are they made of and look at how they um how they play their little game here i gotta be careful because i got a medical misinformation strike on my other channel last night imagine that so apparently they didn't like one of the videos or something that i said i appealed it i doubt i'll win that appeal but i'm down for two weeks on my other channel from doing anything so i have to do a different antics and it's gonna be hard it's hard to speak truth it's hard to tell people the facts because of this crap they're trying to scrub things and rewrite what they want people to look into and they come over on this search engine they're going to get a bunch a load of [ __ ] because they're trying to put this as this labeling it as a blank theory right here okay yeah their disinformation campaign is on and yes it's it's the the cocktails that i'm showing you that are throwing these planes throwing x's up in the sky that stuff's full of aluminum and strontium and barium okay aluminum is why people are having dementia and there's polymers in there which is plastics so it binds together there's graphene in there and this stuff is used against us in multiple ways it's like a spiderweb grid system and it's really deep now you see how this is like what's coming up okay so as as you can see this is uh not good information to go to i mean i would not go on there for any trying truth on that search engine now if you come over to yahoo and type in chemtrails11 barium and strontium this is what you're going to get what are they made of nanobot polymers and ingested by human beings that's what they consist of okay polymers are microscopic and enters the host through air water and our food supplies chemtrail particulates are part of the weather pattern patterns and they're designed to infect the entire human species and there is nowhere a human being can hide now that was just like sums it up and we can go into depth which i have and i'm sure and i'm trying to show you scientifically a multiple videos in my own mad scientist research so yeah this is what you'll get over here if you're going on yahoo and looking into this endangering human health yep okay so i did want to show you guys the difference there of their campaign of disinformation and then if you come over here because this is a book that i have been uh reading for last couple years to learn about the old morgellons disease and what's going on in the skies above with the planes and their deadly death from above the deadly trails they leave and this book dangerous imagination silent and simulation by kara st louis that's the book i have now i typed in this dangerous imagination silent assimilation and i went to videos this is what came up and i would suggest anyone that doesn't believe in all this that i present in my channels all the time is going on in our skies or other people don't understand what's going on or you want to educate yourself into the deepness of how deep it goes this is where you want to come and watch these videos by harold cartsvilla there's one good one um and you can go down this page in the next page and like pick some videos and maybe uh understand the co the complexity of our matrix we live in which is a simulated reality that the puppet masters the elitist create for us in our own cage system so yeah so of course like my channel right now is getting shadow band i had nobody over here i had one person but i had a million trolls on my channel at last night and um the thing is is that it's not going to stop me but uh yeah it is frustrating to say the least yeah it's really frustrating because uh channels like mine are getting buried i don't even know how to find anybody like new going live anymore it's really hard uh youtube has done a good job bearing uh everything so nobody can find anybody in my opinion yeah that's where it's taking us so um here's one thing i wanted to share with everyone since my channel seemed to be getting attacked non-stop with copyright strikes or minimalistic medical misinformation strikes or uh i don't know scam practices blah blah blah whatever they want to take down the same video twice even though i appealed and they gave it back to me whatever their garbage is they don't want a lot of truthers truths getting out there my channel's been messed with both of them so i started another channel nothing on there yet let me take you to it so you i i don't know how to find it but here it is i'm gonna drop the the link in uh chat here in case you don't find me on this one or that one because they've uh gave me some strikes or some [ __ ] and this is my other channel i'll be over live streaming so there you go so on that note yeah let me close that out so i have to be careful what i i i didn't know i ticked off them so bad last night i don't know what i actually showed that uh there's medical misinformation against the who this complete [ __ ] is what it is so okay so i have to watch what i uh play because and what i say because anything to do with the old pandemic scandemic it's it's really touchy and some channels get away with quite a bit but obviously i can't so on that note it's hard to talk about a lot of stuff anymore because our our right for freedom of speech is being taken away and let me show you what i'm looking at this this is a channel and i haven't watched all of them i've i've watched some of them but on my watch list here if you go to this channel extreme reality check all all smashed together all one word this one right here let me make sure i'm showing you guys on lagoon faces in the clouds these words if i say them too many times algorithms will trip up and my video will start buffering and uh cern and you know saturn portal this is interesting uh video i haven't got through it all but good channel check it out might give you inside of the occult and more about their warfare against us and our reality so how's everybody's st patrick's day going here's my uh i mixed milk with irish cream alcohol makes me tired i'm already really tired as it is so i don't have too much and it doesn't make me sick and i hang over so i'm good with that warm fuzzy buzz all right so on that note let's see i'm afraid to show you guys a lot of videos because they are really on my ass and i still want to be able to be able to stream and bring you information so i've got to be careful about what i show let me see this video you get i don't know if many of you know this or probably have heard of it or they're not surprised those who sought all our presidents are linked to one bloodline of exemplifying exceptional character yeah see now i learned that you guys can't hear the video if i mute my microphone but they operated under what was known every time i tried to show videos it always lags so it's really interesting they're starting and they're starting on this channel now where are the assertions you start messing with he is a god the old trolls was not subject to the will of his people but only to be judged by god himself these mighty men of old were successful in convincing others that god's mandate flowed through their veins and that everyday people should spend the best years of their lives working to secure the social order of their realm and for a time this was how the world worked documented in history yeah that's how the world worked and look at where it's at now that's the video you should go watch i'm not going to play the rest of it uh yeah this everything's to one king and that's what our problem is uh i mean it is sad i watched uh press secretary doing her circle backs earlier and uh man if we are in so much danger guys it's just you would wonder where what's what is coming and they let look at this toxic baby food they've known it there's been aluminum in it mercury look at 95 of baby foods are toxic i mean come on why are we putting up with this how are we letting these companies get away with it because it's part they're all part of the problem they're all part of the problem here's another good one never lose truth to k-a-f-k-a if i say it maybe i will get in trouble by this platform so i'm just showing you right here this video good one excellent one right here i showed last night i don't know then i took it they'd say took down my stream so i'm not sure i did so many streams like yesterday that on my channels that i'm not sure if it was the one but this video right here is an excellent video by colt 45 children explaining geoengineering i mean i do you wonder what's going on what they're spraying up there because i have books on it there's been many researches getting scrubbed some websites went down some are still up it's it's crimes against humanity and we all of us sky watchers and many youtubers are posting what's going on in our skies on a consistent basis and let me tell you they've been heavy at it and wow no accountability whatsoever sickening man it's real sickening yeah and then we're going to be going to a casual society which is end of privacy right right now that's what we're giving up is our end of privacy that's what all this is shari law in essence we're giving up all our privacy putting our muzzles on having to dance around our words to be on any social media platform forms speaking any amount of truth or anything against the opposition the controllers it's it's really uh pathetic then i got my channel which has zero people on now supposedly watching me because i'm shadow banned and highly targeted in all kinds of ways and yeah very frustrating to say the least so on that note uh i guess i'm gonna end my stream for a minute and uh try to get some more uh information for another stream but here's uh my uh channel backup channel another channel in the chat log here and i'll start my stream and see if that helps guys because at this point something's going on with my stream that nobody's come in here and i've been on here for what 20 minutes all right much love and light take care ,1
563,"hi this is Richard gage with architects and engineers for 911 truth we're here at one post straight in San Francisco speaking with state director for Dianne Feinstein senator and he brought with him a 45-year explosives expert done danhanson von dot Henson who proceeded to shut our presentation down almost immediately without being open to it at all staining well I've seen all your stuff I've read all your stuff and through the questions and answers that became exceedingly obvious that he hadn't seen or read much of any of he wasn't interested in learning anything he was simply declaring that they would be impossible as Jim Huffman cited how I am not convinced and I will not be convinced and this is what we come up against it is the emotional programming that governs rationality in a lot of people in all of us presumably but him more than others in the case of 911 evidence which we brought and presented before we were shut down but we proceeded to present more evidence nano-thermite spheres lateral injection freefall acceleration building seven evidence coming straight down against 40,000 tons of structural steel all of that evidence was meaningless to him because he could not conceive of how it could be possible that such a conspiracy could happen because after all we would have heard about it by now somebody would have talked our government wouldn't do this to us all of these excuses for not thinking for not looking at the evidence for not being awake enough and willing enough to have an open mind even though they said oh I have an open mind that doesn't make an open mic it's fascinating the psychology we're up against and presenting the evidence for explosive demolition to people who can't conceive of it it's like pouring water into a cup that's already full it can't go in so I was ready to leave after 10-15 minutes but i SAT through a whole lot of other denials of evidence as we presented other points in addition to the building's the hijackers the airline put options the the other evidence that we went through we ran out of batteries this one's still going good so um we're we're done with this office I think yeah they're probably done with us too they're done with us so we'll we'll go to where we can be heard and we won't stop Thanks okay fabulous ",1
55,"listen it's shocking it's written about in the book of Revelation could it ever happen the answer is unfortunately yes total population control bill Benny says that's what the National Security Agency wants he should know he was technical director of that agency and worked there for more than 30 years he became one of their top analysts perhaps the best code breaker in America before he resigns because of their domestic spying programs he's with us now from Washington bill thank you so much for being with us we're glad to see you well thanks for having me Pat look how big is this apparatus of the NSA we hear about it but you know firsthand well they're I think they're about 40,000 people working at Fort Meade at NSA headquarters close to 40,000 and then they have facilities all around the world plus a number of contractors also associated when probably on the order of a hundred thousand I would think to two hundred thousand that worked for them directly so it's a rather large operation I mean it's it's between ten and fifteen billion dollars a year that they spend on it ever since 9/11 so that's you know quite a quite a bit of money they're investing in it how much data can they acquire is there any limit to it actually it the only limit is in terms of money power availability and space to add to stack equipment to go and collect the data material well they use it well you've said that the ultimate goal is total population control in a democracy that is really scary business it's actually a totalitarian process that's been used down through history I mean that's what totalitarian dictators States they that's what they want to do they want to know everything about the population so they can control it that was the idea between behind the Soviet Union the East German Stasi that was their idea and the Gestapo and the SS and down through history many others is our stuff more powerful than those agencies you mentioned yeah unfortunately it is that's that's the real the real problem I see is that it's the capacity is when you're looking at electronic activity of individuals like when you use a credit card and when you when you make a phone call or email anybody on the on the internet or or do chatter on the internet that can be monitored in near real-time if that if they're necessary otherwise they can capture it collect it store it and then Brett to actively analyze it so it's something that it provides the opportunity to monitor everybody in the country in fact most everybody in the world in near real-time throughout the day and that's that's really a 1984 on steroids really all right now let's take mrs. Joe average living in Topeka Kansas and she goes to the store and buy something with a credit card NSA's got that right then they they have electronic data they'll collect Financial Act transactions sure she calls her friend Myrtle down the street that phone is monitored that call not all of them but a good many of them are recorded certainly all of the fact that they she made that call is is recorded and stored and and what we call graphed that is building relationships that's one of the real problems here it this is a violation of your First Amendment rights under the Constitution you have the right to assemble free free free assembly which means that it doesn't say you have the right to free assembly as long as the government knows about it which is what's happening when the telecommunications companies turn over all their records of phone calls to and from with duration that tells them everybody you're contacting your whole social network on the phone because it's a simple matter of doing a reverse lookup to see who that is that you're calling oh you quit the agency oh she said what they were doing is unconstitutional could you that is clearly unconstitutional but why does the government on doing it that's the reason I been able to at least from what I can see in public in the public domain is they're doing it for law enforcement worldwide and actually the main users of this data are in fact FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration and other law enforcement agencies in the in the country and they they use this data to find criminal activity and then they go arrest people based on this information and then they have to do a parallel construction which means they use normal policing techniques that they would be expected to use to find evidence that would justify and show probable cause for an arrest then they substitute that for the NSA data in the in the courts in fact that's one of the one of the one of the things that happened in challenging that process was one of the lawsuits was Amnesty International vs. clapper and that made it to the Supreme Court and the only way they got rid of that was to basically lie to the Supreme Court and say that well if anybody had any of this data used against them in the court of law or anything that the defendant they defendants would be told and that was simply a lie nobody has been told to date all right when I when I think of this it's just horrible what do they give this information to the IRS that's the other problem the Drug Enforcement Administration has a special unit the Special Operations Division the sod and that's the that division is supposed to its primary purpose is to look into the NSA data to find criminality and criminal activity the members of that are the CIA the NSA the FBI course DEA DHS and the IRS now that means that the IRS as active action actually has actually Act access to all the data of the social networks of everybody in the country because NSA builds those in the databases that they have from the billing data or they or the contact data that's provided by the telecommunications companies so this in effect allows them if they're they're interested in stopping anybody getting a 501 C 3 application in for tax-exempt status for for say someone in the Tea Party or the Act Occupy group or any religious group attempting to get 501 C 3 or tax-exempt status they would look could look into that mapped graphed relationships and see if you're a part of any organization that they perhaps when a stone wall or slow roll and prevent from becoming politically active and that's what's been going on they've had access to this data and one person was testifying in the the House and Judiciary Committee I believe it was about some of the questions they were being asked by the IRS and one of the questions that was asked that gave me the idea that they were using this information was this one person was asked what what is their relationship with another person there was a specific name well the question I had was not what was their relationship but how did the IRS know about that relationship the only way I could think of that they would know was B through this access to the data at NSA which is where all that information is mapped out so what you're saying is the NSA slips this stuff to them they read it and get a clue getting it and then they go through their normal procedures and act like it they didn't get the information but he got it from another source so they they pull the wool over Congress do you know the congressman yes go ahead and they also use that in court which means in my in my sense that that that means their perjuring themselves in court so I call that a planned program perjury policy run by the Department of Justice of the United States you know I'm horrified in all this and I'm sure the average of America you know most of the congressmen are they come out of neighborhoods and they're elected by the people do you think Congress has even a clue as to what you're talking about probably not not a complete clue but I think that that's part of the reason that representatives a marsh and Conyers got a coalition of members of the house to try to unfund NSA's activity last year they almost made it by about 12 votes they lost 12 by 12 votes but they came pretty close for a first try so there is a move in Congress to to limit and stop this and it really is all of this activities it's unconstitutional into the first Fourth and Fifth Amendment's the first because they're giving you or your associations and everything the government is collecting that data the fourth because they're looking at the content it's not just metadata that they're collecting its content also and and and the fifth because they're using data that you knew that content of data that you pass between your friends and neighbors and and use that against you in a court of law that's a violation of the fifth amendment that is to have you're not you are claim you can claim the Fifth Amendment not to testify against yourself well that's a violation of that too how come some little guy didn't come after you in the middle of the night or have they they have actually they sent the FBI at me in 2007 and tried to intimidate me to stay quiet what about Snowden is he a traitor or hero I looked at him as a as doing a absolute public service not just to the people of this country but to the world because he produced evidence that's irrefutable by our government that's the crimes against the Constitution and the laws that we had over time anyway so that was irrefutable evidence of what they were doing and so they cannot deny it now what kind of megalomaniac would want to do something like this is monstrous and these guys I mean where does the mindset come from that divides us all this stuff well that's what I objected to and why I left NSA early on back in 2001 because I saw this coming I mean I had worked the Soviet Union problem for almost 30 years and and it was very clear to me that in October of 2001 the NSA and government the US government started adopting the procedures and techniques and processes that the Soviet Union and the Stasi and all of the countries behind the Iron Curtain were using so we were we were actually adopting their procedures it was very clear to me that that was what was going on all right last question the average person doesn't have a vestige of knowledge of what you're talking about they just trust their government what are we going to do as citizens well you see let me let me say something about that first that's that's really the problem here in this country you see from my where I see what I see is we have not had a dictator in this country for almost since George the third for almost two hundred and forty years so we've been very comfortable over those two hundred forty years at least kind of depending on our government to do the right thing and that's what we've all been accustomed to them doing that is we trust them and have trusted them for a long time and so we don't have that knowledge of what dictators and dictatorial processes are but if you look at it the Germans today are the ones who are really upset about this and the reason they're upset is because they've got living memory of the Stasi and living memory of the SS and Gestapo so they're very familiar with these techniques and procedures and that's why they're very upset to me I think the only way we can get out of this is to fire everybody in DC that's the only way to do it you have to go out and vote you have to get active you can't stay quiet and let this happen you have to stand up and oppose it Bill Bailey thank you so much you're great to Patriot and keep speaking out and oh well as prayers for your protection because I can't imagine think unless you keep on talking but maybe they don't man well folks if you want to learn more about Bill Binney and the NSA you can go to our website there's more detail about it and you know something is he was talking the Bible makes a statement in the book of Revelation that people could not buy or sell without the mark of the beast and you said okay there is no way that there's any governmental agency that could enforce something like that and what this man who is the technical director the NSA former technical director is saying is that the government now has the technique to do this worldwide you know Google has maps of every if you have a little shack up in the hills someplace Google's got a map of how to get there and that's a private agency and you know your credit cards your telephone calls but the thing is what he's saying is that you pick up the phone and call your girlfriend and that's monitored and that's recorded and it's it's frightening you don't have to be saying you know I'm wondering a lot against the government but it just it's a normal conversation and they call it metadata and all that stuff and we don't understand it enough so we say well oh yeah well we don't have terrorists we don't have blowing up our airplanes well of course we don't but is it the price of safety for a few passengers on an occasional airplane is that worth taking away the liberties of all the people and the answer is no but this is Big Brother it is what is written in the book of Revelation and it finally can happen in our lifetime this is scary stuff shocking really shocking I remember reading 1984 and books like the late great planet Earth and thinking that could never happen in our country people would never buy into that and here we sit well it's like the old business of the Frog and the water you can heat it up slowly and we're more and more accustomed to it and every time it comes out and they say oh it's okay it's the USA PATRIOT Act it was put in by George Bush these are good guys and this is you got a nice general up there three-star general he's got a benign looking face and you figure he's not gonna hurt you and so he's in charge and then somebody else well we also grew up being taught and believing that the check and balance system in our government was going to take care of all this this is huge the the gathering is in the billions and billions and billions of bits and it is we finally have the capacity to control every human being on the face of the earth clean him up that's what he said throw the bums out let's start afresh ",1

381,[Music] that's the zone because even a lot of interviews you go especially like in a hollywood and a la uh situation um the whole setup of being set up the whole setup is a setup they trying to get something out you they trying to get a sound bite they trying to say something opposed to being on a vibe somebody stand up you got to tell them shut up the whole setup is a setup hey boy get up let up we fed up i'm going head up i'm not going to join him this bars he's going crazy right there he's going yay yeah but they have it where they'll have a person that's just there just to antagonize black people right and we're used to us getting ripped apart so what i'm saying is like we say walter van buren dunker anybody even like black designers i know for me like like everybody been jealous of um everybody that's designed a lot of people that have designed this a lot of people have been jealous of virgil because he got that spot that's the number one spot so everybody can be frustrated you know but when i spoke out on twitter that was not christ-like you know that's why i had to go to my wife and say um you know i didn't cover you the way the way that i i should have and i even said something because we were listening to a christian a playlist and it was all these like new edition songs stuff i was like well she is good at black playlists but you say that and we have a good time man we laugh and stuff but on on quite often we share share scripture and words of inspiration with each other and one thing that sits on me one time is like i love proverbs and like proverbs 2 2 says turn your ear to wisdom in your heart to understanding and i feel like that's what i don't know i tell myself that daily and i feel like i've shared that one with you and and we talk you know cause i always say utilize your voice be the leader that you are you've proven people so proven people wrong so many times so that they don't understand you so when we seek our own understanding through through the word uh it has to like we connecting in a different way but other people ain't going to understand it they've caught they they've called both of us coons they've called us crazy they call these all of these names but when you see like two brothers having a friendly conversation i feel like anybody can tap in and understand that yo this is a man who who loves his family it's a man who has passion for for art for for create creative ideas anything in a creative space but why do you think that you you're so misunderstood when trying to seek your own understanding i just think i say what i feel and i keep it real in a phony situation so that looks wrong truth to power that's what that is yeah that just looks wrong to people you know like uh let's take when i met with jared kushner yeah let's talk about that in colorado yeah cause they said there was a secret meeting that you guys set up in that yeah and ain't no secret he's using you as a puppet that's what they're saying yeah so the thing is i'm not one of these i'm black so i'm democrat 95 95 of black people are democrat yeah i wanted to meet with bernie sanders before he wouldn't meet with me now i'm fine to meet with biden i mean he probably with me with biting right now i would be with anybody i love everybody jesus loves everybody i love kamala harris that's a personal friend hu howard you know but uh but i understand like these this politics is and you you just want to talk to people who share your passion yeah well you know i met with jared that's a that's a friend of mine i knew them before they was in the white house right trump used to go to award shows of puff daddy that is true we all used to put trump in our raps people i was that was that was the american dream to ball out like trump i always remember who someone has been to me um you see i'm saying like that's why when i had an opportunity to do nasa's album this person made ill-matic in fact people was bugged out because it was like you could you even gave him a better album than you gave yourself it's like this man nas is like one of my heroes right he was one of my father figures right nas was one of he was my he was my brother he was he was a uh uh he was my my stylist from a distance what fresh cut what what would nas wear how would nasa cut his hair yeah you know uh and so when i had an opportunity to make music for him i'm gonna give everything i got my grandfather used to say if you're a janitor be the best janitor that you can be and what i like about producing is producing has always been a service position to say let me find something that's going to be in service to you so let me talk about the jared thing i always feel like i keep getting pulled over in my fancy car like when i was 19 i got pulled over for driving a white expedition i had braids peli jacket and when my mom uh came to bail me out um i saw on the police report it said cream ford explorer uh that was crossed out and it said white expedition so i wasn't even the one they looked they just got close enough yeah and they they threw me in jail okay i meet with jared kushner and everybody want to ask me questions this is my this is my expedition i'm driving i ain't got to tell you i don't care if we got ice cream i can meet with whoever i want you know why because i'm free right and so many black people so many people are just not free right i have the freedom to vote for who i want i have the freedom to meet with whoever i want like for me it's like i got friends just like well because of the riots i i know a bunch of people that's like oh we like trump now and then after the riots it was like we hate trump we just got to do everything we get them out i mean it's the protests and all that that's appropriate but let me tell you something people keep on saying i think that y'all you and republicans are in cahoots and cahoots they saying that they paying you to to do what you're doing to be a distraction bro can't nobody pay me you got more money i got more money than trump so you doing this praises through god yeah so what is the purpose of meeting with jared kushner what is the purpose of you know by the way i don't need no purpose now the thing is i have a reason that people would like like that man came out with a printed copy because he couldn't get the paperback version of dr claude anderson's book the power nominee for paranomics and he said so wait jared kushner had power in omics jared kushner talking about black empower comics and had notes red lined underlined quoting lines awesome so anybody who's not familiar with claude anderson this is a dude who's been started in education and just been building for the wealth of black people and the empowerment of black people closing the wealth gap for so long he's one of the things from power nomics that i always relate to is when he talks about blacks are the only people in the united states that don't have communities they're like we occupy residential areas you know what i mean but everyone else has their own community and this is the plan right here claude anderson has a four-year plan to rebuilding the black community right that is what we talked about that's what you and jared talked about yeah but i don't care if i talked and you got some ice cream i could get ice cream that's what i'm saying i don't have to justify right none of my actions period yeah you're because you're free you're free i'm not no housekeeper right what what what has biting done for me that's so special what has he done for me that's so special to make me vote for this man and i don't care about likability right so then and this is you're speaking i'll be frustrated because let me tell you who the most racist the liberal racist when a white person could tell me you gonna split the vote better not step past the line boy right so now but let me tell you here's the one here's the one deep yeah here's the one so this is what this is where i go to a place and that's why i even i i brought up this book by the the great dick gregory god russ is so uh he's our ancestor now but in 1968 one of the most pivotal years like 2020 he ran for president i wouldn't mind the first four years of me that's what so he that's what dick gregory said and he said to be forced to select between a two dominant uh party choice is to have no real choice at all and it's almost that goes back to like what w.b du bois says there's no such thing as two parties there's just one evil party with two names so you are stepping out as pretty much what the declaration of independence says is when you see a flawed government you gonna speak to it for the people but people are saying you're a distraction and because they don't want four more years of trump maybe you might i don't i i don't but but you want an alternative of four years of yay is that realistic right now in 2020 well god has made unreal things happen i'm here for you many times is it realistic for me to be here nah you know you done you didn't cheated death several times you didn't accomplish what most people said you would never accomplish you certified yourself as a multi-genius and a multi-billionaire we just came up with multi geniuses but no because i had people keep on telling me man it's just rude to call yourself a genius okay how about a multi genius and that's something people don't understand yay's sense of humor so he like this all the time and they will say oh well there he go acting crazy again and saying crazy things when really you have a different perspective and you come from it from a place where you're not really trying to this that's what i'm going to say like when people all right so look at this right so this i was wearing it walking through the domes and the ranch all right but i could wash these off and it'd be brand new yeah box fresh now i i saw people talking after the i just saw black people on tv like ridiculing me and dissing me for crying on tv and i you know the whole thing about the harriet tubman thing is we we don't need to tear our statues down to build new ones because we don't got enough statues that's what it is but the only icon is jesus but what i want to say is those people that's ridiculing me bro yin design this come on man so they can't but okay so if they if they ain't make dark fantasy no no dark fantasy and watch the throne right and cruel summer talk your talk and good fridays and late registration i'm just talking about just 12 months i'm just talking about 12 months oh you're right you're right i'm talking about 12 month period yeah i had a friend man i ain't going to go we could edit this out but i was saying that and he was like man cruel summer's trash i said boy you ever made something like mercy mm-hmm like but that's okay so what about all those people who are saying cause granted all of those are genius moves but what about the people are saying you are out of touch so that you can't that's the dream come true but as a leader as someone who's supposed to be guiding people and running for president they want somebody they can relate to so exactly so am i out of touch when i break down at the drop of a dime or the thought of aborting my daughter but some people can say that's instability some people though oh look yay needs needs help because i would say that the world is what's unstable america is what's unstable it would be 100 accurate 22 million 500 000 black people have been executed through abortion culture every so many things that are for the culture do it for the i do this for christ boy this ain't for the culture this is for jesus christ so what about people saying you're a little too religious especially to be running for office uh that's that's what we need and that's who i am and i always been who i am and it's worked out thus far right and i shall be president at some point in our lifetime so maybe not 2020 so what about j 2024 because now because kamala in there i know you don't like biting but you know that to see a woman operating a black woman from oakland went to hbcu to be in the white house you got to want to support that you got to want to see that that's a good thing for the culture and you can follow up 2024. is it a good thing for christ what's your position i i don't know that's a great because when you're a democrat you're not allowed to talk about christ republicans are allowed to talk about christ democrats not allowed to talk about martin luther king was a republican right blacks used to be the republicans back then absolutely blacks used to be and if you're a christian you're most of your values going align with republicans more now you're such an out-of-the-box type of person and you talk you got your own party now the birthday party why why does this is our party this is not just my party our party this is our party the birthday party and and and it's funny because it reminds me of one time we was on and this is when i got kanye we were young we were one of the recording academy packs both trying to get get our grammy grind on and it was a bunch of kids and he was like yo people always treated me all my life you know like tell me to be quiet and all that stuff and he was like no i live my life like it's my birthday it's like you ever go to like chuck e cheese or show biz or whatever and they'd be like yo you making too much noise over there he's like i'm supposed to make this look it's my birthday and i was like i understand him now like he lit you've cheated death you've done something to you you've been that quiet kid in the back so if i was never married to death how can i cheat we've people don't even know you have more than one car accident and things of that nature of like you we've seen you beat the odds many times in so many ways and so that's why you're so outspoken when i said i was gonna run for office and people asked hillary clinton before she ran and they said what do you think about kanye running for office her response was i wouldn't want to run against him who would and when i said so they're scared of you mainly is what this is yeah because the funny thing is even though blacks due to abortion not due to kanye west due to abortion are only we are only thirteen percent of the entire population the entire in america yeah of the vote you know that 13 can make a difference if you ask lewis hamilton that small percent could be the difference in especially when we have the influence the influence that you have and do you see that as a responsibility because you're speaking on some heavy topics from abortion from economics to these things now you know even more so with children when people hear you speak they want they want you to to speak in a direction that one gets rid of the oppression that this administration has put upon our community people live in a sound bite community a sound bite culture where you think one line is going to change everything not no one like do you know how long me and jared sat there and went through uh point by point from claude anderson's book and the time i spent on the phone with claude anderson's wife for the time i spent talking to charlemagne about this this is just the beginning of a journey when we talk about sustainable you know they get all these the democrats are really good at using or the left are really good at using social media to try to cancel people to try to bring them down to try to discredit i think it's four d's it's discredit dismiss yeah and i saw you you wrote you wrote to me about that you know the i i feel like i made a steal like i can't even be you can't be canceled like i can't be cancer but also like i couldn't be hurt i felt like i couldn't be hurt anymore right until you know we we spoke about the idea of aborting my daughter and then that's when you got vulnerable like that that's when i was like i had to i had to i had to feel that because i feel that people might say i'm out of touch because i'm not letting the smoke screen stop my decisions to move forward think about the way the slaves was always controlled it was so many more slaves than the slave master but we were we were brainwashed and we still are right and that's in the past statements when you've made statements whether it's about harriet tubman or even slavery being a choice that's what you were pretty much touching on is like we were brainwashed and we were controlled by the system like carter g woodson says uh once you control a man's mind you don't have to worry about his actions and that's the thing they're not controlling my mind so they're worried about my actions and uh and i'm these are not reactions god is using me and god covers me and won't nothing happen until he's done with me right i mean that's evident the fruits of your labor are evident look the um what about the people who say the devil is because the earth is you know the devil's domain and his dominion and all of that stuff and he said just like the devil tempted jesus and said you can have all i can give you all of these things in the earth do you see like is because i've seen that as well as like oh that's the devil that's the devil especially some of them super duper church going type of christians they want to go oh that's not chris they they hate on sunday service they say oh no that's the devil that's the world that's secular playing and and and being a facade for what christ really is i mean a lot of people got opinions on how to represent christ and some people they argue about the image of christ because you have an abundance you know what i mean like i always said come so you got life and have it abundantly but jesus was me at the same time people were saying oh god told you this god told you god that how god told you god told you but through me god showed you come on bars god told you before me god showed you hey what are we talking about and by the way it it even if i had to go through what job went through where everything goes away you know what i'm saying when i when i because and the reason why that joe went through that is because he feared all of those things you don't have no fear man i see mandela's prison cell and i'm like all right we would ever we would whatever we're not afraid of death 27 strong ones and for his people yeah we're not afraid of prison we're not afraid of death we're just not afraid we ain't going that's period now let me explain something about with me i'm a freedom fighter so my comment to harriet tupman or of her was yeah we got clean more we got to be reminded of how white people did us dirty yeah or how we were slaves or even go to african american history museum they don't start off with the african drums it starts off with the slave boats because i mean it depends what door you going it could be it could be more motivational but they don't they don't they they don't want us to get i say this all the time you're not wrong when they say well our our culture is much more than slavery and that's when we want to talk about you know if we have black history month we need to have black future month just like just like that uh you know i make black history every day i don't need them on i would we was there when yeah i think you gave me that bar i gave him that seat i told y'all i told y'all i gave him the bar but in that sense you you've always exemplified that and it goes back to like you know the richest man that ever lived this is this is who if you ever did a movie or you had irritation you should uh be uh the sultan of mali mansa musa is to this day he his gifts threw off the economy in the 1300s just the richest man ever lived richard and jeremy was like in the trillions but he was an african in in the 1300s he was explorer all of this type of stuff but they they don't teach us about those type of individuals because they want to start with slavery because everything looks better from slavery if you start that flavor everything's going to look like that progress don't give you nothing and if you just get a little sip of water then you look like a horse with a sugar best water i ever had that's how they be happening so they so why don't so that's the whole thing like they don't they show us that we're more than slaves see when people say oh the republicans paying kanye that's like you acting like they got more money than me you acted like i could be paid right bro i saved 100 million in taxes this year right i saved 100 million in tax in taxes right this ain't got numb to deal with one thing i know i know yay for a long time can't nobody tell him to do anything he don't want to do can't nobody convince him with no money he can't nobody convince him it's he's gonna do what he wants to do and it seems that your passion was to show people how much you care i never did it for the money but the funny thing is people call me crazy and they discriminate against people with mental illness or mental mental health abilities right mental abilities because it's actually an ability it's a superpower tell me it's an illness right because i'm seeing the truth inside of a phony world and then people want to lock her up lock me up they want to lock me up for expressing myself do nothing but i don't even do anything but express myself and i'm gonna get hit with the needle and and throne you know what would happen if i got thrown in a crazy home it would drive me crazy that's normally what happens that's what it like and even the infrastructure of what big pharma is and how they you know even from young black boys they always want to diagnose them with something whether they diagnosed me with adhd when i was a kid because they want to get you hooked on drugs early they want to say that they want to give you put you in special education when really you're just on a different frequency and you're on a different way so let's talk about that the fact that people have called you crazy do you see that as irresponsible well i just see that that's a new discrimination that people have to understand because there's even people that are mindful of the word crazy like how post me too men were very cautious in the way we didn't we get you got you got to be careful with your compliments and so now people are sensitive to it and so now whenever i express myself the only problem is people will be quick to be like oh he's going through something and then they try to discredit what i'm saying and we talk about credit a lot of times credit deals with money well i've never cared about money and then people started calling me crazy so then i said you know what i'm gonna do i'm gonna go out and just make more money and y'all gonna stop calling me crazy because i get to a billion you can't call me crazy yeah and then it was two years where i wasn't called a billionaire and then i came out three billion right they even forbes exposed themselves and showed like how i was talking to say y'all can't count right i better count that up count that up again forbes and i really when when bloomberg was coming i just thought about nike and louis vuitton i said yeah i bet you i can get forbes and bloomberg to deliver the message at the same time like when nike and louis vuitton uh delivered and they did but i that's why i like love i love man forbes is some of my favorite white supremacists man they cold bro this is about this like my most favorite white supremacist is forbes uh is tell me why yeah because bro i just gotta like respect they gangster bro cause they they don't live in 2020 they act like it's 18 you know hunted still because they'll be like read the forps it's crazy racist every time they write stuff and people and people would do articles but it'd be like so but now what they keep moving they still in business right so bloomberg was coming and they had an accurate net worth of 3.3 billion and forbes purposely landed an article to dispute that and said well the way we counted it's 1.3 and they dropped it at um 505 or something right at the end of the week so that would go into to the weekend to the weekend right and that would be the story that that it was confusion they could just cause confusion that's something the devil could do is like call devil is the author they're confused they they authored confusion they offer and the funny thing is the guy will still text me and he'll be talking about his daughter i'd be like tell your daughter you got a cool dad and then he'll write an article it's like like you know the funny thing i i was going to curse because i'm like [ __ ] you yay but i really realized just like when you when you say curse what you really do run out of words so let me tell you so i'm thinking people calling me crazy so i'm gonna show them i'm gonna even show my big bro i'm not crazy i'm gonna show jay-z i'm a you know i'm gonna show them that you know that my value that you could be diagnosed and people could point fingers at you and you could still be a citizen and you can still have value he said don't let that stigma define who i am i didn't let the stigma define who i was so the funny thing is so i'm like boom it's gonna be you know they're gonna see that you know i i ate them i ate up all my vegetables i did the right thing and i got up to 3.3 billion i have all my vegetables look guys i'm not crazy look guys i ate up all my vegetables i got three point three and then it's like that guys i got five billion i have all my vegetables and then i cried for my daughter and now he's crazy and they said he's crazy again so that that made me tell us like forget valuing money in that way because i thought that if i would become a billionaire that it could help me beat the stigma but it was because i it's funny because i got friends that soon as someone says oh yeah ain't take his meds or this that they could be like you ain't need to take your and they can send me and it's literally wow like how people would treat black people 100 years ago wow people who are diagnosed can get treated like black people were treated now we're more subtle deep that's deep like nah cause even when you say that because as someone who they've you know called me crazy and you know said i had mental health issues and someone who's actually dealt with many people my family and that thing where that stigma that's placed on you can drive you to a place of depression or um and who who are they to say that you are crazy or who are they to say that you just having a moment and i guess because i feel like i know you and i you know i know the the frequencies we be on like it's not about being defined and that's where it even goes back to the the politics like why do we have to classify or identify with what you deem to be normal and people all human beings have a opportunity to go crazy without being defined as crazy right like when people go to a soccer game they go crazy they go crazy so you put me in certain environments my family would come with me and be paparazzi follow us around and they say what'd they say i couldn't do this i go crazy like there's no human rights in the world i couldn't live your life that would drive me crazy drive me crazy right and so i saw the other side and come back and now it's like a superhero because i really can understand how to use this heightened sensitivity because that's all it is to get more work done think about all the people who have done great things in history think about einstein yeah was was noah crazy when he was working on the the ark as he said don't listen to him no just keep building your art just keep just keep building the ark because by the way it's like even this i i the whole i i speak from the future to the future so even right now this is just documentation that might only make sense to some in the future oh no it's going to be classic it's a classic one right and that because what people always do every time something happens what people got to do go to my old interviews because my only my old interviews can apply to now the majority of the things that i'm saying don't even apply to now yay talking to the future he's teaching us from the future absolutely if you're living in the president if you're living in the future then the presence is your past my presence is the president kiss my ass bars but that's the thing man like and and to relate back to the identity of you know because that's the thing everybody want to talk about is what's going on with yay for 2020 is is you've cleared it up with the whole jared thing and that trump's not paying you and you're not the republicans aren't using you you're doing this solely for the people can we talk about that next step the republicans and the democrats they couldn't afford me bro so let's talk about where you put in the money yeah the children man like and and i really want you to touch on your your love and compassion like we we touched on the heavy subject of abortion but let's talk about the orphanage and the idea of what you want to do moving forward since we talk in the future and even while we're sitting here in wyoming or what you really want to do for what i like about this whole thing is it can be just like how we do a verse because it could be things we kind of hit a point like six seven times in an interview and you said i might wanna hit that twice yeah yeah and it's other things you can hit it in so um we're building plan a and people could say how are you building planet well plan a is exactly what you think about you know planned parenthood and plant plan b well this is plan a and it's exactly what you think that would be that would be given stipends that's creating an orphanage so right now i'm donating my land to build an orphanage all of these acres that we're sitting on right now yes wow so um and that's an openness for for kids from all over the world well it's just to look at orphanages you know we've difficulty yeah we look at them a different way like when i made this foam runner or when i made jesus or mma 808s just to have an opportunity i'm a creative that's the way god uses me through my anointing is due creating with these interviews they'd be funny to me though because i get to create in an interview yeah you painting the picture yeah the interview i i don't know if i you know what people say he's not the best communicator no y'all just don't want to hear what i'm communicating and it's too busy they'll be trying to cut you off and get to the point that's why i hear you have an open forum we chop it up like we chop it up on the phone oh yeah and my new thing is just if someone asks me a question don't give away the secrets don't give it away then they gonna jump in there and try to try exactly exactly not but man to be able to i was like like you live i've watched you from from when your career started to where you are now and everything you put your mind to everything you said you were gonna do you did you know what how everything i put my heart to everything i put my gut to if my heart is in it it's gonna work if my mind if it was just my mind a lot of times people put their mind into delegation let me delegate this let me not put my heart into that that's that time when you are in front of it it's funny it's like with my children i have to be in front i have to be there i have to be present not just the dad that comes with the cool presents uh i have to be present not just the dad just comes with the cool presents um uh a dad or jesse and i have to speak up not just a dad with the cool presents triple entendre for you all one time so because sometimes i've had to speak up i've had i've had to raise my voice certain times on things that i stood for morally right and it's there was a there's a fight for our soul right you know like i struggle with pornography from six years old right um so if i see i remember i went to the library and i and i started taking out all the books that had um you know sexual imagery in it right it wasn't just specifically nudity it could be a swimsuit picture that was hype very hyper sexual right bro it was crazy it was like half of the library because we'll put like a big coffee table book because it's cool in it right and it was like half you know naked woman on the front and then you open it and it has naked and we're so used to that kind of culture that we don't realize that sex is a drug right and when you orgasm what is it endorphins yeah you're releasing all of you and that endorphin is very similar to the feeling of heroin which is which percocets are also a similar feeling to that so so don't mix it right don't have perks and sex and add something to drink you know it's like you don't know which way is up or which way is down right um and that's why like these boxers they'll like sustain they'll sustain for six weeks before the fight that just to sustain and you know to focus to so they get locked in and they they they take the that moment to come combat serious so they don't have any distractions yeah and and even with me as a christian it's like i'm i'm a new christian and i and i backslide and it's funny like the world new world thinking uses the world word karma you christian it's uh you reap what you sow right but karma is new age right that's not the way we even uh that that's not the terminology for it and it's fine god snap pet he knows what we mean but i remember these times where i was under high pressures and high tests from from god and it was like i was passing the test and i saw miracles happening just amazing things just kept on happening and i said well god i know you know the the the form of christianity we believe in we we don't believe in acts so it's some of the acts and i know it's not it's not karma so god why are all these blessings and why all these miracles happening and i had an explanation from a pastor that me and my friend chris julian had picked up hitchhiking that we um then dropped off and uh gave him some money for something like a good samaritan but when when he was talking he was talking about how he backslides but what he said is like when when your lamp is clean when your faucet is clean that god can perform miracles yeah it's like you are getting in the way of your own miracles don't be enough don't be in the way of your own miracles and every time that i pop off all that cocky stuff or we talking that money talk and all that i'm in the way of my own miracles that's why i'd like for us to be able to um to create this in a way where people saw that point there was a point that was building up but we started having these sub points to it but the point was saying that how i thought that money was going to validate me and then i got money as soon as i cried for my daughter people said you crazy and everyone felt like that was a way to down me and that to really understand that that my validation will not be from man and i'm happy that we're as we're here as brothers to be to be next to each other we brothers you know for real because we're going through a lot ridicule yeah a lot of the similar things and i'm happy to just be able to have a conversation because people will say look at this this is the first time that i'm speaking in public since south carolina right and i'm doing it here right here on your show yeah with another person who hasn't spoken since my own controversy so yeah yeah and it's and to speak if you are a public figure speaking in public is therapeutic i use the crowd uh often i use the crowd as my audience that's your therapy right and also you use it to try out some ideas right he said let me try this let me see how the crowd responds to this the reason why i know that i will eventually eventually could be three months eventually could be three and a half years ago four years so um the the reason why i eventually will make a great president is because i'm sensitive i'm here i'm i'm here to serve even as a gemini i feel the energy in the room i read body language i read this energy and i and i hurt you know the thing is this you got that spirit of discernment yeah i i hurt for the country i heard for not just black people but i heard for all all people of america and i heard from all people of the world i heard for everyone's children i heard for the situation i heard i heard for illegal aliens that that have put in their work for 20 years immigrants yeah it's like there's a nation of immigrants that uh john f kennedy wrote like that's yeah that's what this country truly is and for somebody that's that would be probably wrapping it up i would want to talk about the hurt that is going on in this country specifically and the pain that people are experiencing and i feel like that's why a lot of the frustration towards you where they might call us out of touch or crazy or coons or whatever term it is when really it comes from a place where there's a lot of pain going on yeah your music has healed so many your your words your you your outspokenness has healed so many so if they're used to yay healing how in this moment does kanye hill we're building factories we're building farms we're reinstating agriculture talk about the ecology for a minute because people like you said dr claude anderson he put us up on game he said right after the civil war during the reconstruction time where some of the best times that's when america was great uh black people were over 55 of the farmers in this country and now they're less than one percent like that agriculture is where the where the wealth truly was created for this country until this day can continue to be that and now you even stepping into that world yes and for us yeah and yeah and for us and us is you know what is beautiful about the black existence in america it is it it sharpens you just to be a black person in america like i i'm billions i remember spending uh three hours explaining what the white voice was to my to my wife because for her it's just her voice you know it's just the voice just answer the phone the same way hello but i had to explain that in order to get a job depending if you want a job downtown you had to act white and you could lose your job if you acted black but the thing is yourself you that's the thing you're not acting if you act black you're actually being yourself so your existence just to be able to pay for your well-being you literally have to act like a white person it's so funny when i go to like a wedding and it'll be a black pastor and they'll say he speaks so well he speaks so well that's that chris what what do you mean american like i like did you think he was going to talk but yeah it's like how we supposed to speak perfect like i love incorrect english my mom is an english professor i heard her use the word ain't i say don't use ain't mama she said no you could use colloquialism correct english is using the english that's appropriate to who you talking to this is from an english professor come on now so we are way simpler i play this dictionary game where we take a a pocket dictionary and all the people in the room we all get a pocket dictionary we pick a page and you highlight the words that you feel are positive and you read all the definitions now i want you to read the definition of help you think that help is a positive word right yeah the fourth definition is to avoid because you think that help is a positive word but look at how many times where uh look at this even if you meet with a an exec in la they'll not give you the deal but they'll say well how can i help you help me to like i'm gonna give you somebody else number yeah help me understand why oh yeah or how many times something didn't get fixed but a bunch of people helped yeah right the word is to ensure and a lot of the words uh ure at the end have a a a confidence in it and it uh not it's not a word i don't say confidence they have an assurance in them yeah yeah they have a future like oh i see what you're saying and and people can get to that like you can get into the it has affirmation in it negro negligent you could do words that have the because the tower of babylon has caused so much confusion that's why i love you we're trying to get to god yes and then he said boom we're going to give you all your separation yeah so when the pope talks he got to talk in 27 different languages right the the this is why i love non-verbal communication and things where you just see it because you can interpret it for whatever all this senator adams cause you asked me you know what are you doing to heal well i understand words could be healing but i'm not a professional orator i understand you know books can be healing but i'm not a professional book writer you're a professional creative you're a professor exactly i'm a producer but before i was producing things that were non-tangible music in a way you get the feeling but you can't grab it it's an invisible thing you can't eat music teach come on now you can dance for your dinner you could like music could you know it's set up thank you but it's a feeling it's a vibration it's a vibration it's a beautiful thing but i've stepped into a place of actually learning to build physical things yeah physical things building homes building domes a friend of mine said are you building single family homes i said i'm building single family don't homes bars that's how big you were in the verse so um it's that's what i'm doing i'm physically building things like the the thing about this shoe right here it was made in america and my concept is not that my concept is just local manufacturing especially we post cover we decentralize so if you buy this shoe in china it will be made in china if you buy the shoe in america it'll be made in america it's like the idea for manufacturing is the uh the mcdonald's of manufacturing and this is something that we're in stating in the gap like i love the movie the founder and i love the scene when they built the kitchen yeah that was my these are these moments i i watch the making of of movies more than the movies because i want to know how to make them right it's like when you were just talking about hey man i'm an engineer you just kept on saying how was this made because everybody can have a sketch it's another thing to materialize it you know you can ask don c he like travel and if you go to an italian uh factory they have a cup sole you put it there the reason why we up to this point we've had to always collaborate with uh organizations like nike and adidas because they're best of class at materializing this they knew the factories and the biggest fight that i had uh was to get my own factory now we have a factory in cody but this shoe is made in atlanta georgia but we have a factory in cody that can make these eva foam-injected shoes and bring jobs to america truly bringing jobs to america and truly bringing jobs to the community yeah and and redesigning communities and the thing is they don't give you that credit though yeah they want to they want to write you off when you're actually doing so much work but but i'm predicting the future i'm not a i'm not actually talking about the what we're doing right now yeah but but in that in that vibe and as as we as we wrap up you know i mean like i said if you drop so many gems it's gonna be an outstanding canons class but to to clarify and to clear up some things just based off of you running for president right now is that something that you're you're comfortable speaking about because it is it is unclear and i think that's where people could come up with these theories and what you're really trying to do because they're not clear on what your actions are i'm not running for president i'm walking so that's gonna take a little bit more time so you might not get there at 2020 would you say you're walking your way to president we'll take that i'm like spraying the ankle if i run man it's a genius ladies and gentlemen a multi genius we we patent that term and man we got three people yeah yeah yeah but i do want to give you some some content to work with on the the uh the uh running for president thing i believe that you know you jump into the deep end like i i like how trump was never governor wouldn't i'm not even going to go to people saying if he was governor he had been a better president yeah and you got you can admit that trump wasn't the greatest president though right we we know that otherwise you wouldn't be running like that that is a really no i'm i'm running because i was hit with the idea to run in 2020 right now the outcome is up to god right but if i hadn't ran for president 2024 sounds good too yeah if i hadn't ran for president i wouldn't have been in south carolina and you wouldn't have had that moment if i wasn't in south carolina god wouldn't have broke me down and had the media ridicule me in this way right and that ridicule and that being torn hit so home so close to your family yeah to be ridiculed for crying for your daughter the world needed to see me the world needed to see themselves the fact that they would do that right but also i needed to see myself right i needed to see to to to just to recalibrate you know you can you don't learn a lot you don't learn a lot from doing things perfect you learn a lot from things that could be considered a mess up or screw a mistake you say from a mistake not a hell it's a lesson it's because it's a lesson it's not ever say because god don't make mistakes i remember when i was at tmz i said you don't think i told one of my friends i said you don't think that god may have planned for me to be a tmz and his response was i'm agnostic [Laughter] good luck good luck with that that's what you tell atheists good luck because they don't they don't reply to them with the craziest atheists i mean is therapist need a therapist i mean they was pissed as asparagus [Laughter] so look man we could do this for hours because we do this like this we're just letting y'all into how how we vibe and you know a lot of people like man it was just too crazy [ __ ] talking but they might they might want a part two you know we gotta do it in a all right so cool let me get back to the gap [Laughter] but nah man i say this and with all with all seriousness you know every day i try to send you uh some scripture and i think it's like in second corinthians i believe like eight nine it talks about uh where um i think what it is it's like 12 12 8 through 9 that's corinthian second corinthians 12 8 through 9 it talks about uh we're weak for he is strong i mean that's in that yes jesus loves me song but the the part uh before that actually talks about when it says i delight in my weaknesses in the outside insults hardships and persecutions and i feel like you're an example of that of someone who you welcome all of that because you can show god's strength yeah does he say he is strong in our weakness or he yeah yeah it says all that and says therefore i'm weak but he is strong and it shows like he's where i'm weak he's strong and and that's and it talks about the insults the hardships the persecutions people trying to ridicule you and through all that you can show god's strength and i think you've done that time and time again and people could take what you call you can call him call me call us whatever you want but when you can see the presence of of a higher power the creator working and walking it whether it's faith whether it's your opportunity to show your love for your family and humanity i don't see any negative all i see is love and all i see is god in it that weakness is beautiful yeah i'm happy that people got to see that yeah got to see that vulnerable and i'm happy that i've grown through it i'm happy to get to see that i had it because i've had to be so strong that i didn't even know that i could break down yeah i've been through so much i didn't know that i could break down um and we're not just going through it we're growing through it yeah bar yeah there it is i probably got a bar here so we're gonna end it right there you got it uh kanye ten nick what uh it's been an amazing time man my brother i love you dawg like for real let's just keep doing this i thank you for inviting me out here another session of canon's class part two coming this is a classic ,1
13,every once in a while a photograph is taken that is not only disturbing but also incredibly unexplained and there are many out there that most of us are familiar with so hopefully there are a few in this list that aren't as common bar equally mysterious the Grand Canyon mystery man the exact date of when this image was shot is unknown but the person who posted it on the Internet said that it's sometime between the 1970s and 80s he said that his uncle took a trip to the Grand Canyon with some friends and like many they decided to take a picture on the edge of the canyon when they took the camera all to be developed they noticed a very eerie person in the background staring at the camera the man and his friends were in that spot for around 15 minutes and did not notice anyone in the area as the Grand Canyon was pretty quiet at that time of the year the person who posted the photo said that to this day his uncle swears that he or the photographer did not notice anyone nearby whilst taking the photo and have no clue who the man is and why he is hiding in the bushes he sure looks creepy though and people have pointed out how pale he looks and the fact he has his hood up and it might just be a camera illusion but he also looked a lot taller than the other man the biggest mystery of all though apart from the fact who is he is why was he there in the first place as you can imagine there are many theories and all are equally terrifying some believe the man was there to commit suicide but noticed people were coming over so hid in the bushes some say it's the Grim Reaper and others say he could have been waiting to push the man off the canyon thinking he was alone but noticed the cameraman and his friends and decided not to there is no way of knowing if the photograph is real or fake but it has been put through analysis and was confirmed that it hasn't been manipulated meaning if it is a fake then the person would have actually been there and not edited in after so what do you think the disappearance of Tara calico ok so I know this picture is quite frequently used but due to the disturbing and mysterious story behind it I cannot leave out they all started when 19-year old Tara calico sat out for a bike ride on the morning of September the 20th 1988 on a mother's pink mountain bike oddly enough she old her mother they she did not return by noon to come looking for her Tara didn't return Ana murder started searching tracing the route she knew her daughter had taken she did not find her daughter or the bike but found a Walkman cassette player similar to the one her daughter had been listening to and later searches finally cracked walkman cover also believed to belong to Tara her mother became convinced her daughter had been kidnapped but since Tara was legally an adult she had the right to disappear if she wanted to so apparently little could be done without evidence of a crime and despite efforts by a family the trial went cold Tara had disappeared into thin air and no one could help her family solve the case then on June 15 1989 a woman in Port Saint Jo Florida pulled off route 98 to pick up groceries from a food store she parked next to a white van and when she came out of the shop she found this harrowing Polaroid looking photograph beside her car he shows a girl and a young boy in what appears to be the back of a van and the thought of them possibly being in the van that was parked next to the lady who found this photo is truly horrendous the woman immediately alerted the police but Tara's mother did not become aware of the photo for a further two months when she seen the photograph she was sure it was a daughter although thinner and with no makeup a distinctive scar on her leg convinced her it was Tara initially the boy in the photograph was thought to be missing 9 year old Michael Henley but in 1990 Michaels remains were found not far from where he had disappeared two years earlier his death was ruled as a tragic accident and it was confirmed he was not the boy in the photograph Tara's mother searched tirelessly for a daughter up until the day she died in 2006 with the belief the girl in the Polaroid was a daughter and that she was still alive what gets me like I said is the thought of them possibly being in the white van that was parked next to the lady who found the photo in that car park we may never know what happened to the two people in the photograph but we can only hope that no harm came to them it's certainly a disturbing picture to look at and to date who kidnapped them what happened to them and the identity of the boy is sadly still unexplained edna cintron this next picture is very disturbing and illustrates the helplessness of the victims of 9/11 even though this woman appears to have survived the initial impact her chances of survival were very low I know I have already shown a photo from 911 in a previous video but when I seen this one I knew I had to include it although more disturbing than unexplained how the woman and also the man survived the initial impact of the plane is truly remarkable we know that the woman is believed to be a lady called Edna Cintron a 46 year old employee of Insurance Brokers marsh & mclennan but this has never been officially confirmed the photograph shows the area with a plane struck the North Tower of the World Trade Center a gaping hole of mangled steel and molten metal can be seen with the woman very visible and clinging to a severed pillar waving desperately it's incredible that's so near to the point of impact anybody was able to survive at all in that area it was reported at the time that telephone calls from victims confirmed that not all offices on the floors that were hit were destroyed immediately though and several of the trapped fell into cooler areas and the areas where the planes hit would have been the coolest of all as the impact points were sucking in fresh air maybe this lady thought there was a chance that she could be rescued if she got to a cooler area and could be seen with all the helicopters flying around maybe she thought she could have been winched to safety and it's believed that she was there for a considerable amount of time not knowing that the towers would eventually collapse like I said in my previous 911 photo it was truly a horrific event that should never have happened and my heart goes out to all of those innocent people who were taken too soon that day and I know many talk of conspiracies and such but when they do they seem to forget they are talking about an event that killed thousands and left even more families and friends without loved ones so just consider this when giving your opinions this next photo was taken near Zagreb in Croatia the location is popular with hikers and on the day the photo was taken the photographer was with several friends who were all taking photos and messing around but when looking through their pictures they noticed an eerie figure in the distance none of them recall seeing a person around whilst taking the photo and although it's a popular place on this today there were very few people around and even though bored deer and foxes roamed the woods this figure does not resemble any of them none of them can really explain the strange figure and it does not appear on any other photos the only explanation they could come up with is that it was someone who was I group hype who walked off from the group to pee in the woods with his back facing the camera but they still can't understand why they didn't see the person and pointed out that surely they would have at least heard the man if this was the case some people have said that the photo looks familiar to the mythical Slenderman who as most of us know is a terrifying thin very tall faceless man who tries to abduct people the photo has been put through analysis and it's not believed to have been tampered with and none of the group's seen or heard anything unusual on that day that they could link with the mysterious photo the cabin stalker this next photo is a lesser-known one but it's truly terrifying and caused a lot of debate when it was posted on reddit it was taken by a man who was staying any hunting cabin with some family in Michigan that was owned by a family member called Jill on the day it was taken most of the family had gone for a walk and only two of them were left in the cabin after a while one of them decided to take a panoramic photo on his phone of the cabin so he could show his girlfriend where he was staying but when he looked back at the photo he was shocked to see a figure lurking outside the window with what looks like a knife or weapon of some sort in his hand when the rest of the family returned to the cabin some three hours later and looked at the photo they seemed and concerned and even joked that it could have been the dead husband of the lady who owned the house after taking a look outside they discovered footprints leading from the woods behind the cabin to the exact spot where the figure was standing and if that's not creepy enough the next day when they showed the photo to the lady who owned the house she was convinced the man looked like a husband who had passed away a few years before when he was alive he would go out rabbit hunting in winter months and would return to the cabin carrying his catch and his rifle holding them in a similar way to the figure in the photo after they studied photos of her dead husband and compared them to the photo taken there was a definite resemblance in his posture and the bulky hunting gear he used to wear the person who took the photo does not believe in ghosts but has no clue what the figure is and since the family members who went for a walk did not return for a few hours after the photo was taken he is confident it wasn't one of them the photo has been put through a filter and does not show signs that it has been edited so what do you think is that the ghost of the owners husband some have even put forward that it could be the infamous mythical Michigan Dogman and others say that people robbed cabins like this so it could have been a robber who backed off when he noticed the cabin was occupied one thing's for sure though is pretty terrifying and leaves us with no definitive answers so let's five very unexplained and disturbing photographs I hope you've enjoyed and don't forget to send in any mysterious and unexplained photographs you may have thanks for watching and see you next week for another video

283,[Music] did you guys hear about the migrant caravan heading to the united states from honduras i got to tell you about this because the mainstream marxist media just doesn't want you to know about it that by the way is what we do here at disney news we tell you about stuff the media wants to hide i call that lying by omission so what to do click the subscribe button click the bell to stay informed rather than be misled and click the thumbs up button while you're at it the mainstream marxist media made mention of it a few days ago but then they just dropped it from the news cycle the reason is some people are calling this the coveted caravan the reason is it was stopped before it even reached mexico the migrants from honduras were put on buses and sent packing sent back home so why is so little been said about this well i'll tell you the reason is that the far left mainstream marxist media doesn't like to admit defeat and it was a major win for patriots and a major loss for globalism yes we are in fact winning let's think about this for just a second now shortly after donald trump took office the sorrows inspired left began a caravan of caravans one after the other marching through guatemala and mexico to the usa it was a veritable invasion according to some right of center pundits that caravan of caravans however came to an abrupt end even before the coronavirus scared too cold how did trump do it well for one he built the wall as promised but second and more importantly and this is what everyone is missing he created a buffer zone are you listening that stretches from the northern border of mexico to the southern border of guatemala yes think of guatemala and mexico as one massive border wall the driving distance or walking distance if you want to walk it from honduras to the usa is about 2 558 miles give or take a few inches by convincing the governments of guatemala and mexico to stop those caravans donald trump has effectively erected a wall that is nine 1900 fifty four miles wide and two thousand five hundred fifty eight miles deep one thousand nine hundred fifty four miles is the length of the usa mexico border and 2558 miles is the distance from honduras to the usa that my friends is a massive wall speaking of handing globalism a major defeat did you know the president of guatemala is a sane right of center patriot some would call him a trump clone i don't think i'm going to go that far it's a bit overstated but yeah he is a sane right of center patriot he's one of us and yes central americans like americans in the usa are fed up with globalism they're fed up with crime they're fed up with corruption alejandro j mente won the presidency in guatemala on august 11 2019 with 57.96 percent of the vote guatemala's new president-elect alejandro giamatti on his fourth attempt the man they called the eternal candidate has finally won i'm very happy happy and satisfied with the results with the confidence of the guatemalan people but who is giamatte a conservative who aims to resolve what polls say are guatemalan's top two concerns the first security there's a lot of crime and you're afraid to go out because there are many thieves [Music] plans to get tough bringing back the death penalty and restricting rights for gang members in jail and the second a lack of jobs that leads to guatemala sending more people to the u.s border than any other country the problem is that since there's no work in guatemala many people migrate and sometimes it's sad what happens to those who die or get killed while searching for a new future to help their family dear mates promised to stop that creating jobs by increasing tourism and foreign investment to build what he calls an economic wall but even before he took office president donald trump summoned the outgoing president to sign a deal to stop the caravans or face stiff consequences stiff consequences meaning tariffs this way i'll confirm it added to all this is an unexpected challenge a deal just signed by the outgoing president with the us it says that migrants crossing the country mainly from honduras and el salvador have to ask for asylum in guatemala rather than continue to the states if it's ratified it could mean tens of thousands of new arrivals mr giamatte doesn't want that deal but he may have to take it the u.s is threatening tariffs if not so the outgoing president signed on you may notice the dower look on his face as he signs but he signed yes my friends the era of globalism is crashing down hard thanks to alpha males like donald trump and alejandro giamette we are winning they're losing and come november 3 2020. we're looking forward to sending joe biden back to his isolated insulated white neighborhood in delaware ,1
188,[Music] folks who thinks the 2020 election was legit it's a good question who does think that the election was legit clearly most of you probably don't think the election was legit some would say well the democrats yeah the democrats think the 2020 election was legit no they don't so who does the answer is nobody nobody with a half of a brain or someone might say the election was legit but they know it wasn't they would just be lying because of whatever agenda they have everybody knows the election was stolen they saw it with their own eyes um hello five states were stopped five states stopped counting all five were key states all five were where donald trump was leading and he was actually leading in big margins and in the middle of the night ballots were stuffed let alone the discrepancy i won't even go into the voting machines and then we have on videotape republicans being kicked out and them pulling out suitcases full of ballots and running it through the machines in the middle of the night but but that's not evidence of course them being caught on videotape cheating and putting ballots over and over again into the election that's not cheating at all no oh no it was completely legitimate no democrats don't think the election was legitimate i've got the proof that democrats they all know they all know before i get to the proof think of it this way who thinks barack obama is this strong you know christian guy because remember when barack obama ran he said he was a devout christian now if democrats really believed that barack obama was this big strong christian would they have voted for him no they knew he was lying he was just saying it to get elected no one really believed he was just chris if he was a christian like i am a christian if he was like me as a christian a it wouldn't have been part of the democrat party b if he was part of the democrat party the democrats wouldn't have voted for him that's for sure so do democrats know when their own people lie and cheat it's so frustrating of course they know but we don't usually call them out democrats like to pretend to be dumb to get away with things like little children when you have a two-year-old it's in human nature um it's just it's almost like democrats don't grow up and they just use what they did when they were two years old and pretend they didn't know you know when a parent catches a two-year-old and says why did you do that and the two-year-old's like ah well i don't know it's not even two-year-olds you you could have an eight-year-old and they probably do that you know why as a parent you say why did you do that you knew that was wrong why'd you do it well i don't know i didn't even know that i did it i i don't know why they they pretend to be dumb the kid really knows that they were doing something wrong but they think that will help them if they if they act like they don't know they can get off democrats do that with everything uh the election was still oh i i don't know if the election was actually still i don't know yes you do of course you know it's stolen um abortion kills babies well i don't know if it's a baby i i don't know yeah right you don't know that when a woman's pregnant she's pregnant with a baby you don't know that give me a break okay now that we've established that democrats like to pretend to not know things in order to get away with the cheating that they do or evil sinful actions that they do they pretend like they don't know the difference between good and evil they know the difference here's the biggest proof of all though the biggest proof of all that the democrats and especially their leaders know that they stole the election from donald trump is the hr1 bill they are trying to permanently change our election system federalize it and make it so that they can forever steal elections forever more take a listen to sean hannity explain the hr one bill h.r one we've been warning you about it this bill don't listen to the media mob they're wrong as usual this would destroy all integrity in future elections it would eliminate all competence in future election results with one of the biggest most unconstitutional power grabs in modern history if passed the federal government would be able to assert the state's constitutional authority to conduct elections with a series of mandates that would include a mandate for same-day voter registration a mandate for weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks of never ending early voting a mandate for automatic automatic voter registration it would legalize voting for convicted felons even those convicted of election fraud it would give democrats the power to eliminate all voter id requirements none whatsoever in other words hr one makes election fraud uh that much easier it makes election fraud permanent why would you not want people to identify themselves to vote in america i mean why would anyone say yeah we need to get rid of people having to identify themselves in order to vote to prove they're an american citizen the only person that would ever want to not have identification used for people to vote are people who want to cheat and steal elections and the democrats are open about wanting that's why they they do these things they their bills show you yes we want to steal elections yes we want to cheat it's more than that yes we have been stealing elections this way we got away with it it finally worked on a massive scale it's worked before but it was a little bit harder in the past it's not like it's the first time they've stolen an election but not like this and the fact that they could shut down the election do it right in front of your face and then tell you it didn't happen and if you say it happen we're gonna accuse you of being a traitor to your country to intimidate you because they know how guilty they are do not let these punks intimidate you that's what they're trying to do when they do that they're trying to shut you up they don't want someone like me saying these things and encouraging you to say the truth because then they will be busted caught and not get away with their evil ways but as long as elected especially leadership in the republican party because there's some really good elected officials i know some really good elected officials that are elected but they're not in leadership the leadership is too wimpy to even stand up and say you guys stole this election right in front of our face they were supposed to do it before they put joe biden in and completed the task that's when you were supposed to stand up republican leadership that was your window and when you didn't do it and you and i know elected officials elected a republican well i tried but i couldn't i did what i could no you didn't and your leadership didn't and you should have been all over your leadership to say you we got to be in front of microphone saying this election was blatantly stolen they shut down the elections especially in the states that were stolen you should have stood in front of mike's every single day calling the election a stolen election and not being intimidated but you didn't and now you're gonna reap hr1 i know i know they'll have to do with the filibuster the 50 the 50 majority because right now it's not in the senate where they can pass this with just a 50-50 vote but they can use that nuclear option and i don't know why the democrats wouldn't do it they've been able to get away with everything else they've been able to frame donald trump as a russian agent lie about it for four years and all the people that committed a blatant political coup to try to overthrow a presidency got caught red-handed lied to fisa courts lied to congress tried to frame general flynn got caught doing that not one of those people actually paid any significant price at all no one went to jail nothing why wouldn't they think they're above the law there is a two-tier justice system in america it's clear why wouldn't they try to unconstitutionally federalize our elections it's against our own constitution for the federal government to take that power away from the states the constitution gives that power to the states but what do they care to them the constitution they don't like because it's all about what the government can't do to you that's why they hate it and they've realized hey we're above the law we're above the constitution if we ignore it we can violate people's constitutional rights why do they think that they can get away with blatantly violating the constitution they used to lie and act like things weren't unconstitutional when they were but now it's so blatant what they are doing why do they think they can get get away with it i've always gone back to the mask thing when they were able to force everyone to wear masks i kept telling everyone folks if you let tyrannical governors use power they don't have an authority they don't have they can't create law only their state legislature can create the law governor cannot just create law they cannot force you to wear masks if you obey you're not following the law you're not being a good citizen you're giving power to a tyrant and if you give that power to tyrants they will know we can do anything we want they'll just obey even though it's not against the law for them not to obey us it's actually the proper thing to do it's actually the constitutional thing to do is not obey a governor who's tyrannical who oversteps his bounds it's your duty as a citizen to say uh uh i am following that that's a violation of the constitution you're breaking the law governor not me me not wearing a mask is following the constitution because it's my right to choose my own medical decisions and you don't have that type of authority to make a law to mandate that i wear a mask but we didn't stand up as a whole of course some people did but as a whole we didn't and you're going to reap what you sowed you sowed that by obeying and that obedience i warn people on the radio show that i used to do locally i kept warning people and those who used to listen know that i did i said folks you this is not about masks it's so much more and people just get so mad at me it's not a political statement to wear a mask i said oh it is to the left they're watching it's a test they're watching this is why they're having such a hard time letting the mask thing go they're having an extremely hard time they want to keep it forever you know laura ingram was talking about that she was talking about dr fauci too because a year ago dr fauci told the truth about masks i'm going to let laura ingram set this up for you take a listen and just for old times sake let's remember the wise words of dr fauci one year ago today like there's no reason to be walking around with a mask when you're in the middle of an outbreak wearing a mask might make people feel a little bit better and it might even block a droplet but it's not providing the perfect protection that people think that it is of course he later did a 180. it's all for noble reasons though right he went from no masks to you must wear a mask to you must wear two masks it's time for us to break free from the cycle of failed experts and frankly unconstitutional orders if you're trapped in a blue state that won't open up that denies the data and the science that bows to the teachers unions it's time to get get up and either leave altogether or get involved in politics on the local level on the state level in any way you can and even if you don't get involved in politics you need to do your job and not obey tyrants your founding fathers would never wanted you to do so i know why people obey the tyrants they think that they're being polite or they think it's a law and they're being a good christian and they're following the law even if it's not a good law i want to correct those christian christians that think that it is not law they are the ones violating the law you are not breaking a law you're not breaking a bible commandment you're not disobeying the government you are the government in america and you have constitutional rights you're the one who is allowing the law to be broken it's like when you listen to a governor who is overstepping his bounds destroying the state legislature creating his own law becoming a tyrant and being allowed to do whatever it it's like if you watched a bank robber commit a crime and then you defend the bank robber after they stole the bunny what are you doing why are you defending the criminal the criminals here or the people at least who are breaking laws are the governors who enforced infringements on our constitutional rights they stop people from going to church it's right in this constitution you cannot stop people from freely worshiping let alone you can't stop them from gathering and they did that too oh in the name of safety and health right look in a free society you get to decide your risks if someone wants to stay at home because they think you know it's too dangerous there's a pandemic out there stay home i have no problem with that if you want to wear a mask i don't care that doesn't mean you get to be a tyrant and tell me to wear a mask it doesn't mean you get to be a tyrant and tell me i can't go to church where do you get off thinking you have that ability where do you get off even trying to do something like that and where do the people get the courage to take a stand and say what i just said to the people doing that to them oh but they'll come after you the canceled culture will come trust me the cancer culture already came after me i already know and it hasn't stopped me it's only making me have a national voice they took me from a local voice tried to cancel me and now i'm a national voice because i stand strong and god will use me in whatever way he sees fit going forward and i hope that for you i don't want you guys intimidated i want to squeeze one last thing in just see if i can and get this in was tucker carlson and is talking about cuomo remember the media who lied to you about wearing masks has lied to you about everything they have lied to you about how awesome cuomo is tucker talks about that take a listen they spent all their energy slobbering over andrew cuomo been commended for your clear and your calm leadership people from all over the country in the world of tuned into your press conferences your statewide approval rating a career high 84 percent you came in second only to president obama as the most trusted democratic leader in america how'd that happen the media lied at that same time i was telling my audience about how cuomo put people into nursing homes on purpose and i said on purpose because it clearly was on purpose donald trump gave cuomo hospital beds for overflow he gave him a ship and converted it into a hospital and cuomo didn't use it instead said send the sick people into the nursing homes don't put them on the ship that donald trump provided or used the beds donald trump provided put him back in the nursing home now what kind of man does that you know you have these accusations these sex scandal accusations against cuomo i don't want people to get distracted by that i think the left is happier with cuomo having a sex scandal accusation than the truth about purposefully putting patients who are sick into nursing homes to drive up numbers for political reasons you know why because cuomo wasn't the only one who did it that's why there were other other governors who did it pennsylvania michigan we know those governors did it not just new york there's another state but i don't know for sure a hundred percent so i'll just instead of mentioning it i won't say anything but most of you know that these governors were doing it for political reasons and the democrat party would much rather have cuomo have the sex scandal take because remember the scandal about him putting patients in nursing home he was under investigation for that and that was getting in the news this takes that off it it's not that they want cuomo with the sex scandal but what i'm saying is is they might as well allow it because it's taking the real real big scandal off the front page that's kind of sad but cuomo acted like a tyrant cuomo used powers that he technically doesn't have because he can't make law and everyone in new york in new york obeyed and they're suffering the consequences actually of obeying cuomo folks if you want freedom you have to stand up for it do you know how many soldiers died for your freedom they fought foreign enemies and all those soldiers that died on a foreign territory so that people in america could live free imagine what those soldiers think about you not being able to stand up when it comes to wearing a mask you can't stand up for your rights you can't stand up for your constitutional rights how do you think that would make that soldier feel why don't you think about it from that perspective that might shake some people to the core because then that makes them think oh my goodness i might actually have to take a stand is it really that scary to take a stand for the country that you love that you live in why is that a scary thing if you have children shouldn't you want to for their sake folks if the left pounds through what they're trying to pound through it's going to be the end of america if they get away with it there is no sugar coating that what are you gonna do about it [Music] are you gonna be a freedom fighter are you gonna stand up to the bullies [Music] well even if everything goes against us i can give you the biggest hope of all are you ready for this whether you agree with me or disagree with me you better know this it's the most important thing you will hear all day and it's this jesus is the way the truth and the life no man comes to the father except through him do you know what that means do you understand that [Music] if you do and you accept it nothing can keep you down if you don't accept that oh well i'll just say i don't want to be you i love you guys that's why i told you that you ,1
326,[Music] [Music] [Applause] get ready china has started the final stages of its plan while the u.s economy is crashing hi and welcome to the financial argument channel china is a sleeping lion napoleon once warned let her sleep for when she wakes she will shake the world i don't know if the lion that napoleon was talking about woke up but it is certain that the world economies are shaking except for china's i know it's too early to say that china won but it's not too early to say who's losing now we know that almost every country's economy especially the u.s economy is experiencing a collapse and financial crisis unprecedented in history but china seems to have pulled itself out of it at least for now the latest data shows us that the economies of all g20 countries experienced a massive slump in the second quarter excluding china china grew by 3.2 percent in the second quarter while the uk shrank by 21.7 the us by 9.1 percent and the eurozone by 15 india which has recently experienced border tension with china and i think the tensions will continue rising had the worst second quarter with an economy shrinking by 23.9 percent there's more additional data indicates that china is the only country with a strengthening economy while all the rest of the world's economies undergo a painful collapse since march 2020 china has exported 151.5 billion face masks 1.4 billion protective suits and 209 000 respirators to the rest of the world while all this was happening we were standing in modern breadlines trying to get food from a dwindling supply at the food bank or trying to get toilet paper at walmart and millions of americans were filing for unemployment at the department of labor in addition china's exports in august increased by 9.5 compared to august 2019 exceeding expectations while recovery is still just a fantasy for many countries especially the us china is recovering and getting stronger as reported by the civil aviation administration of china civil aviation flights reached 90 percent of pre-crisis levels with more than 13 000 daily flights on top of that at the recent china international fair for trade and services in beijing the civil aviation administration also announced that it had signed international aviation transportation agreements with 96 countries and regions within the scope of the belt and road initiative there is no doubt that china is building a fast and efficient air bridge for the belt and road initiative to expand its passenger and freight services before going into details of the chinese belt and road project it's worth mentioning that while all this is happening the u.s aviation industry has been in a deep crisis since march 2020 as i detailed in my previous financial argument videos although billions of dollars have been pumped into the industry many giant u.s airlines are seriously in debt and on the verge of bankruptcy unemployment in the u.s airline industry has been rising and now the jobs of more than 75 thousand u.s airline employees even pilots are at risk with all employment sectors of our country collapsing china's growing strength poses a risk to everyone it's important to recognize this and tell the truth but sadly some of us refuse to see it of course there are officials who are aware of china's growing strength and the threat it poses president trump made a statement about these developments at a press conference on monday trump noted that the united states intends to halt its economic relations with china threatening to penalize american companies creating overseas jobs and prohibit companies that do business with china from winning federal tenders president trump said he wants to end u.s reliance on china and see made in the usa rather than made in china on goods produced by american companies therefore he wants american companies to move their chinese factories to the united states but i think that seems unlikely to happen the reason why some of the products we buy today are so cheap is that they are made in china american industry is unlikely to be able to manufacture goods at the same low prices american companies in china have shown that they do not take this situation too seriously according to a survey by the american chamber of commerce in shanghai 92 percent of the respondents said they would stay in china we had a week full of political speeches vowing a tougher stance on china and it's obvious that the tension and pressure will increase as we get closer to the elections but the main question is will markets which are already collapsing be able to handle this heavy pressure it's worth remembering that this struggle for domination between the u.s and china has a technological and military side as well as an economic side a report presented to the u.s congress by the u.s department of defense and published in early september includes china's military development providing important data for us as the competition between the two countries is sharpening i reviewed the report in detail i won't talk much about military issues because i focus on economics here at the financial argument channel however the report emphasized that china's advantages outweigh the u.s in certain military fields the report also indicated that china was likely to focus on using its navy to protect its global interests as well as using naval capacity to prevent u.s operations around the world already this week news released by china proves the accuracy of the report for the first time in its history china conducted a drill with two aircraft carriers this chinese military exercise is read as a show of strength to the usa and demonstrating chinese technological skills and achievements they also sent a message with that practice exercise using real equipment in many border regions unlike the soviet union china has tried to downplay its potential as a military threat focusing especially on the fields of economy and technology but now they have raised the stakes huawei and 5g are other issues that have raised concern recently considering the sensitivity of the u.s we can see how important these issues are china has drawn global attention with its growing economy and industry over the last 30 years and its production capacity has significantly reduced inflation in the world economies however there are big problems awaiting china one of which is the potential for demographic collapse according to estimates by 2030 the elderly population of china will exceed the young population and each senior citizen will be supported by only two working age adults by 2039 while couples have been encouraged to have children for the country registrations for marriage have fallen every year since 2013. the divorce rate has increased annually since 2006 and average fertility rates continue to fall hitting 1.7 in 2020 anything below 2.1 indicates a declining population on top of that there are approximately 34 million more men than women in china and currently 24 million single men of marrying age who are unlikely to ever marry or have children according to the general belief china controls 1.4 billion people by increasing their welfare china's rise has been built on labor-intensive manufacturing and has very little in the way of a social safety net if china doesn't invest in technology and r d this aging population will be in trouble that's why china has pushed for technological development and back in 2008 it was officially accused of technology theft a special 301 report published by the american department of commerce states that china has copied or stolen patented american intellectual property joseph nye richard haas and other experts who report on china have stated that china can no longer continue doing this and needs to develop its own patents that's exactly why xi jinping came to power xi jinping has embarked on continuous efforts and investments to develop chinese industry and increase productivity huawei oppo vivo and tiktok have all developed as a result while nokia and erickson dominated the mobile phone market before she 51.3 percent of the mobile phones used in china in 2015 under xi were of chinese origin this is of course thanks to quality improvement not only that but 371 million mobile phones manufactured domestically were exported and the majority of them were mobile phones produced by chinese r d xi jinping did all this thanks to supply-side structural reforms and this miracle was called the chinese dream apart from mobile phones huawei has embarked on an even more ambitious business 5g the money invested in the 5g project by the people's republic of china has exceeded 180 billion 5g offers significant economic opportunities beyond the internet and communication considering the emphasis placed on industry 4.0 by the west and the point it has already reached the process of smart manufacturing and creating new operating models will speed up thanks to 5g if 5g is based in china countries with american military assets and the security of many military operations information and intelligence data will be under threat it's not difficult to predict how disastrous the result will be if the databases the nsa collected from europe are transferred to a chinese infrastructure that's why the nsa has officially visited a lot of countries in europe as you can see the usa is concerned not only about china's potential commercial gains but also its potential loss of security information apparently china believes that the time has come taking advantage of the collapse of its rival america and the rest of the world's economies and has started to put all its cards on the table china will not hesitate to make its biggest moves in the uncertainty before the november elections what will the next few months bring it's best to prepare for a worst-case scenario thanks for watching and your support of the financial argument channel,1
130,[Applause] [Music] foreign [Applause] this is the paul mcguire report i'm paul mcguire america is in chaos and you see that on the various mainstream media news channels specifically the cable news channels other channels video audio social media and the internet at the same time that we see chaos in america we see trends movements indicators of uh positive outcomes for a lack of a better term things that will implement positive change some change is good some changes evil or awful it depends what is within the category of change and we always have to remember that america is a completely unique nation it's different than the rest of the world not just because i say so or somebody else says so because it is it's a factual statement to say that america is unique among the other nations of the earth thus the term american exceptional america is the only nation on planet earth which is governed by legal documents that were produced from biblical thought or a biblical worldview because our founding fathers like thomas jefferson abraham lincoln george washington or whoever whether or not they were quote evangelical christians whether or not they were like pilgrim or puritan type christians or whether or not they were some strange hybrid theology somewhere between the bible and freemasonry they say that's impossible and you may well be right it may well be impossible to synthesize those two opposite theological belief systems because one is occultic one is biblical but in any case because of the superior excellence of the biblical pilgrimage educational institutions in the 1600s and 1700s all of our founding fathers were exposed to intelligent intellectual historical philosophical theological they were exposed to biblical thinking rigorously and a biblical worldview why because the pilgrim and uh puritan educational establishments were so superior to any of the others on every level not just the spiritual level the historical mathematical level as well they were so superior that even if a founding father was a person who embraced freemasonry or masonry or whatever they were still inundated with biblical thought and it showed up in the decisions and the unique legal or documents we have for america called the bill of rights and the constitution final mind is that no other nation has a bill of rights and a constitution that provides anywhere near as much freedom as ours does period and that's what makes america america american exceptionalism because it is every other nation begins with a quasi tyranny even if it's a soft tyranny even if it's a subtle tyranny it's a quasi tyranny because it does not embrace the truth that our founding fathers said should be self-evident that it is the creator capital c that has given us certain inalienable rights that means rights that are given to a people by god since they're given to a people by god they can't be taken away by a finite government that the creator capital c has given us certain inalienable rights such as life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that produces freedom of religion freedom of the speech freedom of press and many other freedoms which allows america to be the only nation on planet earth that has what's called the american dream think about this for a moment this certainly is never talked about in the marxist socialist educational systems that dominate america and that is the truth that america is uniquely free because of its biblical worldview it's never even acknowledged by the marxist professors who who have infected our educational system with a virus far worse an ideological virus far worse far more deadly than the coronavirus because it it produces a death sentence for people at a higher percentage rate ultimately than the coronavirus does so what's happening in america now today as you're listening what's happening in america today is impacting and affecting the entire planet earth in endless endless ways because we set the tone we set the model for freedom or or loss of freedom right now as i've said countless times and i've titled the title of my book the greatest battle for the hearts and minds of mankind in history of the world that's where we are now and in a very short period of time america will have chosen a pathway that either guarantees the preservation of your liberties of your freedoms of the right to buy and own your own house to pursue an american dream america will either have embarked on that pathway he says no uh there's no middle ground or america will have embarked on the pathway of totalitarianism bring up big big brother an orwellian totalitarian regime a dictatorship it's one road or the other and anybody who does not acknowledge the fact that there are at least two fundamentally basic different roads that produce two basic fundamentally different futures is either chronically stupid on the area you're so stupid you should be arrested it should be a crime that's how stupid you are criminal criminality is stupid or you should be arrested for your stupidity either you fit into that category and that's why you can't grasp what's going on or you fit into the category of you know nothing about history and the historical precedent because every single nation on the face of the earth that has embarked down the path of socialism marxism has always ended up in a unfree totalitarian state with poverty with no social justice with all your freedom stripped and stolen from you by a big brother government there's no deviation as we know and there's no exception to this rule absolutely none it's a hundred percent death rate for nations that embrace communism socialism yet in the light of that you have these uh pitter-patter airhead christians who who live in some who float above the ground as they walk they're so spiritual they're so ignorant of the fact that the fundamental characteristics of a marxist atheist socialist society fundamental characteristic is that buried beneath all the rhetoric on social justice and redistributing wealth and oh how much we love you and buried beneath all of that stuff is the historical reality that people who embrace this communist marxist socialist state always end up living in a tyranny they never get their social justice their wealth redistribution their freedoms are taken away and they become uh prisoners in a concentration camp type of society that's the historical record that's why since communism um has invaded numerous nations with its deception various communist revolutions that have occurred over the last 135 years or so have produced a total death rate of around it's always secretive 240 million people have died through starvation execution shot to death concentration camp re-education camp um or they send the people in communist societies who don't adhere to communism into mental hospitals where they have wrought and died this is this is reality so not to know reality and not to know history really is a crime especially in light of the fact that the people who are going to suffer are the children and the grandchildren and the little children and the children becoming into young adults and adults etc in fact every age category of men suffered brutally under no exception no deviation to that rule and right now america is voting whether or not literally to send us into a communist socialist future or let's call it a capitalist christian future which way which way will america choose yeah america has been dumbed down you know that but america willingly signed up to be dumped down especially in the church they were the first line and now as anything god's law of sowing and reaping which is phrased by many kind of slang expressions like the chickens come home to roost is kind of another way of saying uh the law of sowing whatever you sow so should you reap you start promoting and spreading the doctrine of communism like seeds and soil which is the hearts and minds of little boys and little girls you're going to have a harvest of wickedness a harvest of evil it's inevitable that's what you sowed you sowed wickedness what kind of harvest did you expect in the same way jesus christ tells us that uh whatever we sow so shall we also reap but jesus christ also tells us to go into all the world and preach the gospel evangelize the loss what is that you're planting the seeds of the word of god soil which is the hearts and minds of mankind in order to reap a soul harvest which means to win souls for jesus christ to evangelize the loss that's the purpose of paul mcguire ministries and paradise mountain church is to evangelize the loss and jesus tells us regarding our time period that the harvest fields are white for harvest but the laborers the amount of people willing to go out and bring in and and plant the seeds for the souls to be saved and then to bring in spiritual harvest through evangelism the laborers jesus said are few that's characteristic of our time but this ministry paul mcguire ministries paradise mountain church along with you who are partners with us you're committed i'm committed to not only saving souls but to bring in the last day of soul harvest jesus said fields are white for harvest but the laborers are few why are the fields of white for harvest because we're in the last days the prophetic signs are being fulfilled and god it's god's prophetic destiny for america and other nations and regions of the world it's god's prophetic destiny for america to act as a great vehicle of god for a great last days soul harvest which we can go out and reap because the harvest is is what white feels her wife for harvest people are at such a place emotionally and spiritually that there are countless millions of people ready to uh receive christ into their lives in fact the most powerful thing that we can do to change a family a people a nation a community one of the most powerful things you can do to change any of these things for the better is to effectively preach the gospel of jesus christ to effectively win souls to to effectively bring in the fields that are white for harvest yes spiritual warfare is essential yes being informed and active is essential yes but along with that other things that we should be doing is preaching the gospel and winning the laws making disciples of all nations and occupying the land will become this is there's nothing that is as powerful as that in terms of transforming a nation we complain about the evil and the evils and the wickedness in america one can understand why but the evils in wickedness in america there is a cure there is an antidote and the antidote is the aggressive preaching effectively of the gospel of jesus christ in order to win souls that will transform any people group any nation radically and so that is what paul mcguire ministries in paradise mountain church that's our number one goal and that's why i ask you on a regular basis to be intercessory prayer partners with us praying for me my family in this ministry that's why i ask you to spread the links of our programs our social media our internet media to spread them far and wide to under ordinary uh circumstances get what we use and that's why i ask you to go before the board seek to take the lord and simply ask the lord how much would you have need to give financially in terms of contributions or donations paul mcguire ministries paradise mountain church and whatever the lord tells you to do you obey him because that is how we are able to fund and support and activate the preaching of the gospel of jesus christ the making disciples of all nations teaching of the word of god and on numerous platforms as you know right now we're expanding our platforms we're uh adopting multiple new platforms as a edge against censorship and that's why you need to write down or put yourself on or how whatever you do to remember paul mcguire ministries at fridayon.com bradyon.com and our main portal is paul mcguire us and we're going to be adding to you other social media platforms because there's a war against the truth on the internet i was watching it today a number of biggest of the biggest tech giants you know arrogant uh thinking that they can act like uh self-serving gods and just deciding that they're going to censorship this or that these people don't believe in free speech they believe in what whatever they say goes whatever their perspective is is the right perspective that's a totalitarian approach there's no respect for the beliefs of others whether you agree with it or not america is great or has been great because it has been a champion of freedom of speech that means everybody whether you agree with them or not has an opportunity to communicate with their speech or technology or whatever openly now that's changed in america because freedom is under assault why is freedom under assault because secretly behind the scenes the globalist elite along with the trillions of dollars they have to spend are re-molding america reshaping america to be a globalist little unit inside of a globalist control dominated one world government one religion one world economic system the new world order predicted in genesis 11 when god judged ancient babylon at the time of the power of babel divided it from being a one-world government into many independent uh nation-states all of this is happening now it's like a whirlwind and there are powerful interests that are totalitarian like the way they control the masses your children my children grandchildren other people's children adults the way they control the masses is through mass mind control which occurs primarily through the internet through social media through television through episodic tv through movies through films through music through uh lyrics so-called scientist speaking but only certain kinds of scientists scientists like all the other groups i just mentioned have to be carefully pre-screened their so-called scientific beliefs or their so-called beliefs as entertainers must adhere to must inform to whatever the big brother orwellian view dictates or demands at the present moment so there's no freedom of speech there's only freedom of big brother type speech that's where we are and see where this leads that's where we are but where it leads is to the place where they tear down all platforms that preach biblical christianity or preach conservative ideas based on the bible or whatever all of those platforms and individuals using those platforms will be shut down and silenced because a dictatorship does not tolerate it it talks infinitely about the need for being tolerant it talks infinitely about the need to respect diversity but in practice it it rules dictatorially on an infinite basis brushing out all freedoms all freedom of speech all all diversity uh is tolerant of nothing it's the it's the ultimate paradox the free speech movement which began in the late 1960s when i was a little kid i i supported the belief systems of the free speech movement which occurred at the university of berkeley and the free speech movement basically was a national movement adopted by the hippies and the radicals which i was part of which said that you have the right to say anything you want to say you have the right to believe anything you want to believe that's what free speech is but when the people who who adopted this idea of free speech in their free speech movement they didn't calculate the wrong turn that the entire radical liberal movement would make over the next decades they didn't they didn't calculate where the free speech movement would ultimately end up and that is it ends up in a place where you have no free speech where a word has to be evaluated on whether or not it's politically correct and if a word or a term is not politically correct then it is censored it's deleted and there's mass surveillance technology along with artificial intelligence etc etc which is constantly scanning the internet scanning websites scanning emails scanning every part of your life in order to determine whether you're adhering to the big brother totalitarian directives or not there's that's where we are and this place where we are is a new world order america which is completely different than the original america which was america now the real game plan for this new world order america is to shove america into this globalist finance one world government one world religion one world economic system or what is known as the new world order and the new world order will prop up and continue to enrich the super elite super wealthy and it will continue to destroy the lifestyle the income uh of the working class and the middle class under the guise of saving the planet via climate change or whatever the latest bruises whatever the latest con game is now god's given us this time in history right now this time because this is the time that once you walk through the door you can't get back in when you walk through the door when you walk through the door into the wrong future unfortunately the door self locks you can't get back in because if you walk through the door of the wrong new future you're not allowed to go back and to retrieve beliefs that they've carefully filtered out you are in a giant sensor machine a censorship machine that cannot be undone you need to think about that because that's where we are right now and the future that we walk through will determine future of our children and grandchildren god is sovereign the lord of the bible is sovereign jesus christ as king of kings and lord of lords his prophetic word will come true within the time period of god's prophetic word coming true there's going to be a variation of the level of persecution the level of martyrdom the level of loss of freedoms there will be a variation in the intensity of that as you go from neighborhood to neighborhood state to state geographic area the geographic area nation to nation and nations where the collective tone spiritually of the people for example in america where people are fervently biblical for people are committed to the bible old testament testament where people are committed to evangelism those areas uh will go in a better direction than those states and communities that are built on a collective worldview of socialism or marxism or communism why people shared this before ideas produce consequences good ideas produce good consequences and bad ideas produce bad consequences so it's important that you dedicate i dedicate my life to the communication to the dissemination of good ideas which are our ideas based on biblical ideas and that we do everything we can and everything in our power to spread those good ideas which are god ideas which come from the bible that we do everything we can to spread god's word to other peoples to young people people all over this nation to communities all over the world that's the that's the primary spiritual weapon that can preserve our freedoms so you and i need to obey the word of god where it teaches us to do this and so we need to be committed as most of you are prayerfully i am by god's grace that's why paul mcguire ministries is committed to moving forward to bringing in this last day soul harvest to communicating a biblical worldview and by acquiring technologies that will enable us to avoid the schemes of the evil one that wants to censor and tear us down and with your help your financial partnership your donations your prayers your willingness to spread our message far and wide we can overcome or do an end run around uh censorship machines that are aggressive and use artificial intelligence we can do an end run around we you and i need to brace ourselves whatever the outcome of this election is there is going to be a season of turmoil and chaos and all kinds of weird stuff erupting and we need to pray now like we've ever prayed before and we need to pray ongoing fashion and then we need to pray for our nation after the election no matter who wins because we're going to enter a period of chaos and our prayers are are willing to use the spiritual authority that god has given us our prayers can be used by god to occupy the land until jesus comes because there are behind the scenes forces of evil forces of good for forces of wickedness forces of righteousness because ultimately as we talked about on the paul mcguire report countless times our fight is not with people not with political groups our fight is not against flesh and blood but our fight is against the principalities against powers against the dark unseen forces of wickedness in heavenly places so our primary battle whether it's for us as individuals is spiritual but our primary battle also is spiritual and encompasses nations elections cultures etc etc all of these things and the souls and destiny of millions of people all of these things can be changed or or altered by effective spiritual warfare so i ask you to to join with me in what i call the greatest battle for the hearts and minds of mankind and see the world go to paul mcguire.us and look at our book bundle discounts help us spread the message far and wide and every day it's just not how many minutes or hours you spend it's the fact that you're praying in accordance with god's word coming into the throne room of god boldly because of his grace through the blood of jesus christ and you are choosing to obey god's command upon your life you're choosing to be obedient and to be an intercessory prayer warrior and a spiritual warrior as you fight against invisible powers in the invisible realm spiritual powers of evil and together we're to be one in christ one in the supernatural body of christ fighting these principalities fight is gone we don't have much time what what is what is about to happen is is the tracks are being laid on you know the railroad tracks are being laid down on the ground train's about ready to come very quickly you need to simply ask the lord lord lord jesus i ask you give me wisdom what you want me to do regarding anything wait on the lord until he answers you and then you don't exalt your own imagination your own will your own decisions you don't exalt that above the voice of the lord speaking to you through his word don't do that that's idolatrous you obey the lord who's speaking to you through his word or if he's speaking to you through his spirit it's always in conforming to god's word god will lead you step by step and you'll know exactly what to do and you'll feel good about that decision because that decision is the decision that will bring you freedom know the truth and act on the truth you're set free the goal here the game plan areas is to be resolved in your heart and mind that you are well able to occupy the land spiritually as joshua and caleb said and so you place and you're well able to take the land not because you're such a hot shot or whatever but because your faith is in the supernatural power of god as we exercise that together we're able to occupy the land the devil is going to occupy it we're going to occupy it and that also means occupying the land in the time of an election god bless you this is your brother paul mcfire is it paul mcguire.us that's paul mcguire.us the clock is ticking is it paul mcguire us for all kinds of free resources but remember the clock is ticking you're either praying in a serious serious way or you're awol from spiritual battle i i challenge you to engage in the spiritual battle and to be functional as a spiritual prayer warrior and to obey what god is telling you to do now now is the time you may not have i may not have this opportunity blessed god bless you your brother in christ paul mcguire visit paul mcguire [Applause] us [Applause] [Applause] [Laughter] [Applause] [Music] [Music]

437,hey y'all now dmx of course passed away and i'm trying to put two and two together um back back in the day he had this album called uh flesh my flesh blood of my blood now i couldn't find the um the the video of him where was not of him as uh why dean from rough riders uh saying that this blood is basically chicken blood and he and he's in the tub so you know like that that just you know like it's like real crazy even when you look at even when you look at this picture you know like you said you know like wow you got real blood chicken blood so i don't know what type of uh coke ritual was that you know with with the tubs and you know uh there was a uh other artist that was in tubs like uh i believe lil wayne was in the tub with the six foot seven foot video when he fell back in the tub and then tupac of course when he was in the tub now what goes on is that it it had his death happen this week which is uh you go to a list of say 10 holidays this is say 10 holidays and what i gotta do i gotta scroll down i guess so you see you see what i'm see what i'm on i'm on list of satanic holidays i'm on a pdf and easter was this week so so it's the weekend of easter and easter week so that's why it says date varies right here and what they do is the blood sacrifice see it says human sacrifice of course male or female female adult you know so and it's in this eye that you know all these celebrities are dying at the age of 50 and you know they're dying at the age of 50. and the thing is you know they all seem to be dying of you know drug overdoses there was a um video let me see if i can find it uh let me see there was a video uh dmx had the uh took the so-called vaccine there was a video i can't i can't find it right now dmx uh okay why was that it's not popping up it's not popping up right now dmx dies nice after that well i'm after i'm gonna have to look forward later well yeah he did he did uh take the vaccine and this it was said uh by the uh family members i guess uh the family members had said something about uh family members had said something about uh what you call it yeah right here hey guys check this out i just got it certified from home i don't have the editing tool uh i know y'all don't want to watch that but you know yeah they go with a little break but i did want to give you guys this update so listen very closely a family member of dmx has exclusively spoken with mto news and let them know that there was a possibility that the kovid 19 vaccine could be a factor into how dmx suffered his heart attack and is now currently fighting for his life in a white plains hospital now previous reports have said that dmx did indeed od on some kind of narcotic or drug which led to him having a heart attack and not receiving oxygen for 30 minutes which led to him having to go to the hospital with possible levels of brain damage due to the lack of oxygen but this family member believes that after dmx took the coven 19 vaccine a week ago in hopes that he could get back on the road and start traveling and performing again that that's how everything went left now i'm not sure who the family member is because the family member is not named but they do not believe that there were any drugs involved in this occurrence so i really want you guys to sound off in the comments and let me know do you think that there is a possibility that maybe drop yeah well the vaccine is killing a lot of people you know a lot of people are dying of this vaccine of course if you look deep into uh you know their adverse effects now this is just for europe now i know when um i know in um uh the united states i believe they are um only one they only report up to one to ten percent one to ten percent according to the doctors now of you know like people dying uh was a reporter that recently died um and you just just start start start looking at all these all these deaths and all these heart heart attacks and all these other stuff you know and you just you just you just got to do your research all these deaths all these vaccines you know they they only make uh they only make vaccines that's uh you know eighty percent is is is not eighty percent of the population is not gonna uh it's not gonna um have too bad of effects but twenty percent usually is the the key number usually but yeah you you see what's going on so i guess they shot him up at the age of fifty but with these deadly vaccinations and you know god got him up out of here and uh you know that that chicken blood stuff you know i should i should look that up chicken chicken blood rich what is that chicken blood chicken blood ritual power in the blood they bring sheep uh i don't know i'll look up that later voodoo headless chickens yeah chicken blood for the soul animal ritual oh man animal sacrifice animal sacrifice ritual killing offering of an animal it's a religious ritual um so that so there you there you have it you know that's just that's just the way i'm i'm looking at things you know ritualistic you know the cult of you know uh these sacrifices that you're gonna make in these uh music business this is my opinion ,1
67,you know if you're done having kids you should also look into a vasectomy I'm never gonna do that just take away my manhood I got some partners that did that I might yo what if like that's what we're here for like as much as cuz I may not want kids today but what if I want to you could freeze your sperm yeah that's either that's to us so that's weird to me like I want the process well listen and I'm not I don't know you Mariah's personal business right but the majority of the celebrity twins see that there are done anything in vitro yeah yeah you use it using in feature like I said I don't know your situation and that'sthat's y'all business interesting because Pete I know everybody assume that with our kids but it was it was more I would say because Mariah's at the time just her age and that we thought about oh we should do this and that and it was more it was more about not a full in vitro process but I believe you know because twins actually run in my family everything but I think we actually were doing things that and taking some medicine to make sure we could stay pregnant because all right we had had miscarried a few times before really yeah so yeah you know and it was you know like I said there's those type of things where it's personal information right but it's you know and how we we actually it was probably early on in our marriage where we had gotten pregnant and was planning to tell everyone it was a beautiful situation I and I remember this story is stories crazy I never about told a few people just but it was like there was this time where we were it was during the holiday season you know Ryan's big on holidays mean more eyes promoting one of her Christmas albums at the time and she went on Ellen and there were all these rumors that rusty remarried that Mariah was was pregnant and at the time she actually was you know I mean and but we didn't want to tell anyone because was too early and that Ellie had since that she was so she wanted to do this big old pranking about Mariah's gonna announce it on their show and so she was gonna offer Mariah champagne and so and she's like hey Mariah drink this and she's like now I'm not drinking and then she was like why the only reason why you would not drink this is if you're pregnant you're Mariah Carey you always have champagne it's the holidays look take a sip she's like I'm not drinking Ellen and it was one of those things to where it was funny in the in the context but literally two days later we we miscarry or she you know and it's like how you know what I mean like that could even be in a great moment of Ellen was the first one to reveal it but then now it's kind of like it's a slap in the face to where you're like damn there was a reason why we weren't telling people and then that process when when two people were trying to have children like that's a very personal and intimate experience and that takes a lot out of the woman it puts a lot on your relationship and so for you know I think what that was Oh 8 for the next two and a half years that's all we were focused on and I some time thinking is me as I should do I need to take some [ __ ] forgiveness my little swimmers stronger and so yeah we can you go to you know doctors and they tell you about DJ tell you about all the things that you can do but then ultimately like we were like yeah we want to do this I was like we'll take any assistance right but we don't want to like go all the way and you know yeah but less - - so they say like something all of those you know medications can enhance this and do that and it is always find it really bizarre that all these celebrity women have twins and but I mean JLo Beyonce Twitter a robbery right like twins are incredibly rare readily random or those people just happen to have them oh what a coincidence fashionable right now I'm not buying it it's like I said it is what it is but be safe out there there are options every shitty game Truvada are you looking as doctors if I could take Truvada yeah absolutely and it's one of those things where you know if you're gonna be out there like that you know it's like you go wear a bulletproof vest before you you walk into that war field yeah are you just gonna hope that you could duck real quick you know you got to also understand like you know uh I personally believe HIV is chemical warfare and in its truest form anyway yeah they'd like to get rid of certain groups of people yeah and it worked yeah but at the end of the day and now garlis a super rare I mean regardless of how it developed it's still out it's still out there there's no cure and you know what you mean and you sure about that no magic Johnson you've got a special cure it's not just only what that is publicly it's not a death sentence because the actual medication that you could take once you get it you could live just as long as you would without it as long as you stay on your medication there's a cure for every man-made disease it's man a man made it it was made in the laboratory if they made it they got something that can get rid of it now how much they gonna charge you for that oh yeah ,1
96,do they think we're idiots look at that plain as can be there's no hiding from bill okay we're going to do a little experiment vikra if you'll follow me up here what i have here as everyone knows leaves protect from 5g radiation so i'm just going to shield myself i can feel that in my back of my neck i'm just going to and we're going to leave two eggs here two full eggs not boiled not anything we're just gonna leave them there and we're gonna come back to that ah can you feel that it's about three minutes now i've left those two eggs there as you can remember let's have a look oh it's very hot i'm nearly afraid to touch it but that i can feel already look at that how did that happen ,1
325,"Juden peterson you've said that men need to quote grow the hell up tell me why well because there's nothing uglier than an old infant there's nothing good about it it people who don't grow up don't find the sort of meaning in their life that sustains them through difficult times and they are certain to encounter difficult times and they're left bitter and resentful and without purpose and adrift and hostile and resentful and vengeful and arrogant and deceitful and and of no use to themselves and of no use to anyone else and no partner for a woman and there's nothing in it that's good so you said I mean that sounds pretty bad yes Isis of masculinity I mean what do you do about it you tell you help people understand why it's necessary and important for them to grow up and adopt responsibilities why that isn't a shake your finger and get your act together sort of thing why it's more like but why it's more like a delineation of the kind of destiny that makes life worth living I've been telling young men but it's not I wasn't specifically aiming this message at young men to begin with it just kind of turned out that way and it's mostly you admit it's mostly men listening I mean it is your audience is well it's about 80 percent on on YouTube which is a YouTube is a male domain primarily so it's hard to tell how much of it is because YouTube is male and how how much of it is because of what I'm saying but you you what I've been telling young men is that there's an actual reason why they need to grow up which is that they have something to offer you know that that that people have within them this capacity to set the world straight and that's necessary to manifest in the world and that also doing so is where you find the meaning that sustains you in life so what's gone wrong then oh god all sorts of things have gone wrong I think that I don't think that young men are here words of encouragement some some of them never in their entire lives as far as I can tell that's what they tell me and the fact that the words that I've been that I've been speaking the YouTube lectures that I've done and put online for example have had such a dramatic impact is indication that young men are starving for this sort of message because like why in the world would they have to derive it from a lecture on YouTube now they're not being taught that they that it's important to develop yourself because it doesn't bother you that your audience is predominantly male does that isn't isn't that a bit divisive no I don't think so I mean it's no more divisive than the fact that YouTube is primarily male and tumblr is primarily my female resident tumblr is primarily female all right you're just saying that's the way it is oh it's I'm not saying anything it's just an observation that that's the way it is there's plenty of women that are watching my lectures and coming to my talks and buy my books it's just that the majority of them happen to be men uh it's what's in it for the women though well what sort of partner do you want you want an overgrown child or do you want someone to contend with that's going to help you your eye on women have some sort of duty to sort of help fix the crisis masculinity it depends on what they want no I mean it's exactly exactly how I laid it out like women want deeply want men who are competent and powerful and and I don't mean power in in the in in the in that they can exert tyrannical control over others that's not power that's just corruption power is competence and why in the world would you not want a competent partner well I know why actually you can't dominate a competent partner so if you want more you should dominate is that what you're saying no I'd say women who have had their relationships impaired with impaired their relationships with men impaired and who are afraid of such relationships will settle for a weak partner because they can dominate them but it's a suboptimal solution do you know when they were doing I think there's a substantial minority of women who do that and I think it's very bad for them they're very unhappy it's very bad for their partners although the partners get the advantage of not having to take any responsibility what gives you the right to say that I mean maybe that's how women want their relationships those women I mean you're making these vast generalizations I'm a clinical psychologist right so you've you're saying you've done your research and women are unhappy dominating men I didn't say they were unhappy dominating then I said it was a bad long-term solution okay you said it was making them Israel yes yes and it depends on the time frame I mean there can be there's intense pleasure in momentary domination that's why people do it all the time but its nose formula for a long-term successful long-term relationship that's reciprocal right any long-term relationship is reciprocal firstly by definition so let me put it quite to you from the bank well you say there are whole disciplines in universities forthrightly hostile towards men these are the areas of study dominated by the postmodern stroke neo-marxist claim the Western culture in particular is an oppressive structure created by white men to dominate and exclude women but then I want to put minorities - okay but I want to put to you that here in the UK for example let's say that as an example the gender pay gap stands at just over 9% you've got women at the BBC recently saying that the broadcaster is illegally paying them less than men to do the same job you've got only seven women running the top footsie 100 companies hum so it seems to a lot of women that they still being dominated and excluded to quote your words back to you it does seem that way but multivariate analysis of the pay gap indicate that it doesn't exist nine percent cap ager that's a gap between median hourly earnings between men and women yeah but there's multiple reasons for that one of them is gender but it's not the only reason like if you're a social scientist worth worth your salt you never do a univariate analysis like you say well women in aggregate are paid less than men okay well then we break it down by age we break it down by occupation we break it down by interest we break it down by personality but you're saying basically it doesn't matter if women aren't getting to the top because that's what's skewing that gender pay gap isn't it you're saying well that's just a fact not so you know it's not going to get to the top no I'm not saying it doesn't matter either you're saying remindful reasons for it even though why should women put up with those reasons why shouldn't women because he should put up with it I'm saying that the claim that the wage gap between men and women is only due to sex is wrong and it is wrong there's no doubt about that the multivariate analysis have been done mighty very I'm saying that nine percent pay gap exists that's a gap between men and women I'm not saying why it exists but it exists now you're a woman wack seems pretty unfair you have to say why it exists but do you agree that it's unfair if you're a woman not necessary and on average you're getting paid nine percent less than a man that's not fair is it it depends on why it's happening I can give you an example okay there's a personality trait known as agreeableness agreeable people are compassionate and polite and agreeable people get paid less than just didn't less agreeable people for the same job women are more agreeable than men again a vast generalizations agreeable ears that's true but that's right and some women get paid more than men so you were saying that by and large women are too agreeable to get the pay raises I see so I'm saying that that's one component of a multivariate equation that predicts celery it accounts for maybe five percent of the variance something like that I should be neat about the other twenty you need about another eighteen factors one of which is gender and there is prejudice there's no doubt about that but it accounts for a much smaller proportion of the variance in the pay gap then the radical feminists claim okay so rather than denying the pay gap exists which is what you did at the beginning of this conversation shouldn't you say to women rather than being agreeable and not asking for a pay rise go and ask for a pay raise make yourself disagreeable with your book oh definitely there's that but I also didn't deny it existed I denied it existed because of gender okay because I'm very very very careful with my words so the pay gap exists you accept that but you're saying I mean the pay gap between men and women exists you're saying it's not because of gender it's because women are too agreeable to ask for pay rises certainly one of the reasons okay one of the reason so why not get them to ask for a pay rise I've done that many many times in my career and they just don't sort oh they do it all the time you can see so one of the things that you do as a clinical psychologist is um assertiveness training so you might say often you treat people for anxiety you treat them for depression and you and maybe the next most common category after that would be assertiveness training and so I've had many many women extraordinarily competent women in my clinical and consulting practice and we put together strategies for their career development that involved continual pushing competing for higher wages and often tripled their wages within a five-year period of course so do you do you agree that you would be happy if that pay gap was eliminated completely because that's all the radical feminists are saying it would depend on how it was eradicated and how the how how the disappearance of it was measured and you're saying of men that's a problem oh there's all sorts of things that it could be at the cost of it could even be at the cost of women's own interests so because they might not be happy if they could equal pay no because it might interfere with other things that are causing the pay gap that women are choosing tonight having children well or choosing careers that actually happen to be paid less which women do a lot of but why shouldn't women have the right to choose not to have children or the right to choose those demanding because they can yeah that's fine but you're saying that makes them unhappy I and large I'm saying that that no I'm not saying that I'm I and I actually haven't said that so far you're saying it makes them miserable no I said what was making them miserable was having part was having weak partners that makes them miserable right I would say that many women around the age of I would say between 28 and 32 have a career family crisis that they have to deal with and I think that's partly because of the for short and timeframe that women have to contend with like women have to get the major pieces of their life put together faster than men which is also partly why men aren't under so much pressure to grow up so because for the typical woman she has to have her career and family in order pretty much by the time she's 35 because otherwise the options start to run out and so that puts a tremendous amount of stress on women especially at the end of their 20s I think I take issue the idea of the typical woman because you know all women are different and I want to just put another quote to you from the book last day in some ways and the same in others okay you say women become more vulnerable when they have children no and you talked to one of your youtube interviews about crazy harpy sisters so a simple question is gender equality a myth in your view is that something that's just never gonna happen it depends on what you mean by equality no if you mean a lien and we're getting the same opportunities fairly people we could get to a point where people were treated fairly or more fairly I mean people are treated pretty fairly in Western culture already but we can look them really not though are they I mean otherwise why would there only be seven women running footsie 100 companies in the UK why why would there still be a pay gap which we've all got satellite sees why are women at the BBC saying that they're getting paid illegally less the men to do the same job that's not fair sort of the first question their brothers are complicated questions seven seven women repeat that one there's seven women running the top footsie 100 companies in the UK well the first it might be um why would you want to do that why would a minute man want to do it I don't know a number of men although not that many who are perfectly willing to sacrifice virtually all of their life to the pursuit of a high-end career so they'll work these are men that are very intelligent they're usually very very conscientious they're very driven they're very high-energy they're very healthy and they're willing to work 70 or 80 hours a week non-stop specialised at one thing to get to the top so you think women are just more sensible they don't want that because it's not a nice level I'm saying that's part of it definitely and so I worry you you don't think there are barriers in their way that prevent them getting to the top there's some barriers yeah like other like men for example I mean to get to the top of any organisation is an incredibly competitive enterprise and the men that you're competing with are simply not going to roll over and say please take the position absolutely all-out warfare is gender equality a myth I don't know what you mean by the question men and women aren't the same and they won't be this that doesn't mean they can't be treated fairly is gender equality desirable if it means equality of outcome then almost certainly it's undesirable that's already been demonstrated in Scandinavia because in Scandinavia equality of outcome is undesirable what men and women won't sort themselves into the same categories if you leave them alone to do it off their own accord I've already seen that in Scandinavia it's 20 to 1 female nurses to male something like that it might not be quite that extreme and approximately the same male engineers to female engineers and that's a consequence of the free choice of men and women in the societies that have gone farther than any other societies to make gender equality the purpose of the law those are in eradicable differences you can eradicate them with tremendous social pressure and tyranny but if you leave men and women to make their own choices you will not get equal outcome right so you're saying that anyone who believes in equality whether you call them feminists call them whatever you want to call them should basically give up because it ain't gonna happen only if they're aiming at equality of outcome so you're saying give people equality of opportunity that's fine not only fine it's eminently desirable for everyone for individuals and for society but still women aren't gonna make it that's what you're really it depends on your measurement techniques they're doing just fine in medicine in fact there are far more female physicians than there are male physicians or there are lots of lots of disciplines that are absolutely dominated by women many many disciplines and they're doing great so let me put something else to you from the book you say the introduction of the equal pay for equal work argument immediately complicates even salary comparison beyond practicality for one simple reason who decides what work is equal it's not possible so the simple question is do you believe in equal pay well I made the argument there it's like it depends and say you don't because a lot of people listening to you will just say I mean are we going back to the Dutch because we're actually not listening I'm just projecting I'm hearing you basically saying women need to just accept they're never gonna make it on equal terms equal outcomes is what how you defined it no I I would go I might as well just go and play with my Cindy dolls give us a ride at school because I'm not going to get the top job I want because there's someone sitting there saying it's not possible that's what they said it's a it's a bad social role I didn't say that women shouldn't be striving for the top or anything like that because I don't believe that for a second striving for the top but you're gonna put all those hurdles in their way as has been in their way for centuries so that's fine you're saying that's fine no no I think I read the paper silly I do I think that's silly I really do I mean look look at your situation you're hardly unsuccessful yeah Maya how do you beg hard to get exactly good that's ok battling is good this is inevitable but you talk about man fuck let me just put another thing to you for now you're saying you have to be idle for a high-quality position well I notice in your book you talk about real conversations between men containing quote an underlying threat of physicality oh there's no doubt about that what about real conversation between women is that something or are we sort of too amenable and reasonable no it's just that the domain of physical conflict is sort of off-limits for you we just to get where I've got yeah but what does that make me I don't know man I don't imagine that you've yeah to some degree I suspect you're not very agreeable so that's the thing successful women I'm not very agreeable right actually in this conversation at least I'm sure I served your career well successful women though hmm basically have to wear the trousers in your view they have to sort of become men to succeed is what you're saying well if the guys had to fight to succeed better Canadians men certainly masculine traits are going to be helpful I mean one of the things I do in my counseling practice for example when I'm consulting with women who are trying to advance their careers is to teach them how to negotiate and to and to be able to say no and to not be easily pushed around and to be formidable and you need to if you're gonna be successful you need to be smart conscientious and tough well here's a radical idea why don't the bosses adopt some male bosses shall we say adopt some female traits so the women don't have to fight and get their sharp elbows out for the pay rises it's just accepted if they're doing the same job they get the same pay well I would say partly because it's not so easy to determine what cost due to the same job an almost because arguably yeah there are still men dominating our industries our society and therefore they've dictated the terms for so long but women have to battle to know like them it's not true it's not true so for example well I can give you an example very quickly so I worked with women who worked in high-powered law firms in Canada for about 15 years and they were as competent and put together as anybody you would ever meet and we were trying to figure out how to further their careers and there was a huge debate in Canadian society at that point that was basically ran along the same lines as your argument is that if the law firms didn't use these masculine criteria then perhaps women would do better but the market sets the damn game it's like and the market is dominated by men no it's not the market is dominated by women they make 80 percent of the consumer decisions that's not the case at all you take people who stay at home looking after children by and large they are still women so they're going out doing the shopping but that is chained they make all decisions okay so the market is driven by women not men right ok and if you're a lawyer you still pay more for the same sort of goods that's been proven that men for the you buy a blue bicycle helmet it's gonna cost less than a pink one anyway we'll come on to that partly because men are less agreeable right so this so they won't put up with it I want to ask you is it not desirable to have some of those female traits you're talking about I'd say that's a generalization but you've used the words female traits is it not desirable to have some of them at the top of business I mean maybe they wouldn't they don't predict they don't predict success in the workplace the things that predict success in the workplace are intelligence and conscientiousness agreeableness negatively predicts success in the workplace negative emotion saying that women aren't intelligent enough to run these talk no I didn't say that I said that female traits don't predict success but I didn't say that intelligence it wasn't I didn't say that intelligence and conscientious when you were saying it's just by implication or not female traits oh no I mean that's sorry no dressed her not saying that at all a women is intelligent than men no no they're not no they did that on that's pretty cool the average IQ for a woman and the average IQ for a man is identical there is some debate about the flatness of the distribution which is something that James d'amour pointed out for example in his memo but there's no difference at all in general cognitive ability there's no difference to speak of in conscientiousness women are a bit more orderly than men and men are a little bit more industrious than women the difference isn't big I don't know about averages into con men who aren't necessarily why are they not feminine traits why are they not desirable at the top of feminine traits why they not desirable it's hard to say I'm just laying out the empirical evidence like we know that we know the traits that predict success but we also know because companies by and large have not been dominated by women over the centuries we have nothing to compare it to it's an experiment true and it could be the case that if companies modified their behavior and became more feminine they would be successful there's no evidence for it I'm not neither doubtful nor non doubtful there's no evidence why not give it a go as the radically evidence suggests well it's fine like if someone wants to start a company and make it more feminine and compassionate let's say and caring in its overall orientation towards its workers and towards the marketplace and that's a perfectly reasonable experiment to run my point is that there is no evidence that those traits predict success in the workplace and there's evidence right well that's not that's not really the case women have been in the workplace for at least ever since I've been around the representation of women in the workplace has been about 50 percent so we've run the experiment for a fairly reasonable period of time but not you know certainly not for centuries let me move on to another debate that's been very controversial for you and this is you got in trouble for refusing to call trans men and women by their preferred personal pronouns no it's not actually true I got in trouble because I said I would not follow that compelled speech dictates of the federal and provincial government I actually never got in trouble for not calling anyone anything I wouldn't follow the change of law which was does not once I was law screaming hell no that's all they said it was designed to do okay you cited freedom of speech in that why should your right to freedom of speech Trump a trans persons right not to be offended because in order to be able to think you have to risk being offensive I mean look at the conversation we're having right now you know like you're certainly willing to risk offending me in the pursuit of truth why should you have the right to do that it's being rather uncomfortable well I'm I'm very glad I put you well I'm you get my point as like you're you're doing what you should do which is digging a bit to see what the hell's going on and that is what you should do but you're exercising your freedom of speech to certainly risk offending me and that's fine I think more power to as far as I'm concerned so you haven't sat there and I'm just right I've just trying to work that out I mean ha gotcha you have got me you have caught me I'm trying to wake up turn my head yeah I took a while it did yeah well you have voluntary cut you have voluntarily come into the studio and agreed to be questioned hmm a trans person in your class has come to your class and said they want to be called that's never happened and I would call them she so you would so you've kind of changed your Chi no no no I said that right from the beginning what I said at the beginning was that I was not going to cede the linguistic territory to radical leftists regardless of whether or not it was put in law that's what I said even then the people who came after me said oh you must be transphobic and you'd mistreat a student in your class it's like I never mistreated a student in my class I'm not transphobic and that isn't what I said well it said you've also called trans campaigners authoritarian how many I mean isn't that only in the broader context of my claims that radical leftist ideologue czar authoritarian which they always say someone who's trying to work out their gender identity who may well have struggled with that though I'm a drug use you're comparing them with you know Chairman Mao who know just you know the deaths of millions of people just even if the activists you know they're trans people too they have a right to say these things yeah but they don't have a brain inside their whole community heaven too Chairman Mao you know I could finish a all cost a penny sure I mean you know this is grossly insensitive and I didn't compare them to finish it well I did come here knowing he knows no authority he's a right-winger though I was comparing them to the left-wing totalitarians and I are left now at Aryans under Mao millions of people die right mean there's no comparison Mao and a trans activist is there why not because trans activist aren't killing millions of people the philosophy that's guiding their utterances is the same philosophy the consequences are yet you're saying that trans activists know it leads to the deaths of millions of people well no I'm saying that the philosophy that drives their utterances is the same philosophy that already has driven us to the deaths of millions okay tell us how that philosophy is in any way comparable sure that's no problem the first thing is is that their philosophy presumes that group identity is paramount that's the fundamental philosophy that drove the Soviet Union and Mao is China and it's the fundamental philosophy of the left-wing activists it's identity politics doesn't matter who you are as an individual it matters who you are in terms of your group identity you just say murder so to provoke on you I mean you are a provocateur never say a lightly they don't write that you hate to be compared to you want to stir things up I'm only a provocateur insofar as when I say what I believe to be true it's provocative I don't provoke maybe four heroes out now and then I'm not interested in provoking what about leading about you know fighting and the lobster tell us about the lobster ha well that's quite a segue well the first chapter I have in my book is called stand up straight with your shoulders back and it's an injunction to be combative not least to further your career let's say but also to adopt a stance of ready engagement with the world and to reflect that in your posture and the reason that I write about lobsters is because there's this idea that hierarchical structures are a sociological construct of the Western patriarchy and that is so untrue that it's almost unbelievable and I use the lobster as an example because the lobster we we divulged from lobsters in evolutionary history about 350 million years ago common ancestor and lobsters exist in hierarchies and have a nervous system attuned to the hierarchy and that nervous system runs on serotonin just like our nervous systems do and the nervous system of the lobster and the human being is so similar that antidepressants work on lobsters and it's part of my attempt to demonstrate that the idea of hierarchy has absolutely nothing to do with socio-cultural constructions which it doesn't let me just get it straight you're saying that we should organize our societies along the lines of the lobsters I'm saying that it's inevitable that there will be continuity in the way that animals and human beings organizing organize their structures it's it's absolutely inevitable and there is one third of a billion years of evolutionary history behind that right that's that's so long that a third of the billion years ago there weren't even trees it's a long time you have a mechanism in your brain that runs on serotonin that's similar to the lobster mechanism that tracks your status and the higher your status the better your emotions are regulated so as your serotonin levels increase you feel more positive the emotion and less negative emotion so you're saying like the lobsters we're hardwired as men and women to do certain things to sort of run along tram lines and there's nothing we can do about it no I'm not saying there's nothing we can do about it because it's like in a chess game all right there's lots of things that you can do although you can't break the rules of the chess game and continue to play chess and biological you're your biological nature is somewhat like that is it sets the rules of the game but within those rules you have a lot of leeway but the idea that but one thing we can't do is say that hierarchical organization is a consequence of the capitalist patriarchy it's like that's patently absurd it's wrong it's not a matter of opinion it's seriously wrong on you just whipping people up into a state of anger and not of all the divisions between men and women you're disturbing people up you know you have any critics of you online get absolutely lambasted by your followers young generally sorry your critics get lambasted by you I mean if there are not at all if an academic is gonna come to me and tell me that I'm not qualified and that I'm not I don't know what I'm talking about now quit the abuse quit the anger well we need some substantial examples of the abuse and the anger before I could detail that quest there 'he's a lot of alpha4 well let's take a more general perspective on that so I have had 25,000 letters since June something like that from people who told me that I've brought them back from the brink of destruction and so I'm perfectly willing to put that up against the rather vague accusations that my followers are making the lives of people that I've targeted miserable Jordan Peterson thank you my pleasure nice talking me  you",1
448,what's up my youtube family it's your boy roberto checking in with another conspiracy video guys so stick tight watch this video because i am about to talk about the new world order and how the republicans the reptilians and the demon democrats are starting to work together and how this means this is terrible news for the rest of the world and the united states so stay tuned and watch the video so in case you guys don't know the demon democrats and the reptilian republicans have been somewhat getting along like getting along and starting to agree with each other on certain topics the republicans are starting to change their views on certain things and the democrats are starting to change their views on certain things and the reason this is very important is not because we already know they divide the country intentionally between parties they have one they have you have your republican people you have your democrat people and then you have the people that are just very few people there just in between so now what they are doing because this is all the scheme this is all part of the plan these politicians quite frankly don't care about us and they probably never will care about us but the whole goal is to deceive us and divide us by having two different parties and making people hate each other one party has these agreements one party has these agreements in the end they have a big disagreement and guess what we the people pick parties so when our party doesn't agree with the other party we attack one party and guess what we do to those people that support that party we attacked them too well now what you're seeing is the republican the dem the republicans and the democrats trying to get along and this is all planned by them because they're working towards a one world government and this is the bad part this is why i say it's not good for us yes it may stop division within the country if the parties do start getting along and starting agreeing with each other yes on paper it does not look like they're agreeing because anytime they vote on something it's still the same thing but the disputing and the arguments are starting to calm down and they're starting to agree on certain topics a lot of topics they're starting to agree on and that is the scary part because they're planning this correctly they're going to start agreeing more they're going to make the people in the country think that we're starting to unify as a as a country as a whole the parties are starting to work together which is what they should be doing without trying to manipulate us but the only reason they're doing so is because they are working towards a new world order a one world government and in order for the united states to get this one world government and to get this new world order in place they have to get along they have to work as one they have to work as one party they can't be divided these politicians cannot be def divided and there's not no problem for them but they're trying to find a way to slowly get the american people to work together and to not be divided anymore so that when we take let me not say we when the american government takes over the world as the new world order the new one world government it won't be any division within the country the the country will be a team together and the government of the united states which will nine times out of ten be the leader global leader of the world because we already are the global leader of the world but we will to be the ultimate government of the world the president of the united states will be the president of the world so what they have to do is get us together and they're gonna divide all the other countries they're gonna put they're gonna they're gonna put more division within the other countries and the countries that are unified they're gonna break that up they're gonna break it up and the reason you don't want a one world government because everybody follows the same set of rules everybody answers to the same person everybody abides by the same laws and the scary part is it's gonna start turning into a dictatorship we're going to start seeing the president the most powerful person in the world become a dictator because the power is going to get to their head their american government is going to enjoy this power having control over the rest of the world this is what it's always been about it's controlling the world the united states has always been a controlling country wanting to butt into everybody's business wanting to control everybody's country wanted to control everybody's resources [Music] and if you don't listen to the united states they go to war with you and they take over that way [Music] the united states is moving one step closer to the new world order the elites know this the elites are pushing for it and once the united states decides to band together as a government they're gonna they're gonna they're gonna take over all the other governments they're gonna kill off leaders like kim jong-un vladimir putin they're gonna they're gonna take they're gonna go out to china's president but i'm pretty sure he'll take a step to the side because of fear so not only will the united states run the most powerful country in the world then number two more than likely the vice president to the united states president or the country of the united states will be china's president and we all know how that's gonna go the united states is going to implement strict rules on other countries we may see us going in reverse back towards another time slavery with the united states bullying other countries and using the other countries people the workers for hard labor guys the new world order is among us martial law will come into effect the united states will start putting people in fema cap fema camps this is not what you guys want this is not what you want and not only that united states is already greedy so countries that are already poor is gonna get milked of all their resources and not only that the countries that are rich right now not going to say necessarily rich but very strong economies are going to get milked by the united states united states government will take over the rest of the world they will make every country poorer they will make every world leader bow down to them they will strip countries of they have kings and queens they will strip them of the crown all the resources will be coming back to the united states yes we may be living good here but think about the rest of the world guys if we're getting much closer to a new world order martial law will come into effect military united states military will be in some of the streets of some of these countries forcing their citizens to abide by the laws y'all stay woke and watch as the united states government starts to band together they have a plan and the plan may hurt the rest of the world big time and this may be when the aliens decide to step in stay woke guys have a good day ,1
4,hi it's Lily Hubbard here and in today's video I will be talking about the mass mind control experiment that's being taken that's taking place globally and how the world is run by Satanists so I'm shining some light on a really dark trip on some really dark truths and Ephesians 5:11 says have no fellowship with the fruitless deeds of darkness but rather expose them so what is mind control every culture and society is under some form of mind control and I live in Thailand I've been here for the last seven years my husband is Thai and this is a Buddhist country and the the main belief in Buddhism is mindfulness and in mindfulness you're not allowed to think about the past or about the future you're supposed to be always living in the now and this has had a very detrimental effect to the culture to the nuclear family into society because and it's stopped critical thinking if you're not allowed to think about the past you're not allowed to contemplate history to contemplate your path your past actions and if you're not allowed to think about the future you're not allowed to plan for the future or even hope for a better future it keeps people emotionally stunted so I'm from the United States and in the US and Western society in general we are also sold alive through our education system and our governments and our mainstream media and what is not spoken of publicly is the fact that most of the people who run the world are psychopaths they're Satanists they're practicing Satanists and they're pedophiles they are involved in some of the most egregious crimes against humanity that include organ harvesting human and child sex trafficking torture and even cannibalism many of your favorite Hollywood celebrities humanitarians and philanthropists are involved in these activities I know it's shocking and hard to believe believe if you've never heard of this before I've been searching for the truth for nearly a decade and it took me years of researching asking questions and seeking the truth to finally figure out what's going on in the world and I can never truly comprehend how it all worked until God found me and I accepted Jesus as my Lord and Savior and I became a born-again Christ follower it was then that I realized that one could be a Satanist and not even know it in fact most people practice a form of Satanism as the core value of Satanism is the worship of oneself or the God within it is the original lie that the serpent told and they told Eve in the Garden of Eden that if we eat of the fruit of knowledge that we will become like God for years I was on the path of enlightenment I traveled the world seeking answers and searching for mental healing and emotional stability through Eastern religions I was a practicing Hindu and I was involved in various occult activities looking back I can see how Satan used me to influence others and lead people to eternal damnation I was actually a lower-level Illuminati member and I didn't even know it because I was a I was teaching yoga and pushing the belief of reincarnation on people believing that it was not true myself and reincarnation is also the original lie that Satan and the serpent told Eve that if you eat of the fruit you'll never die and that's what reincarnation believes that will never die that we're always being reborn into a new body so when I found out that it was all a lie and that hell was real and that we live in a prison planet and that the god of this world is Satan which is why Jesus had to come here and the only way out of this prison planet is through accepting and Jesus who is the ultimate sacrifice the perfect sacrifice for our sins so we can escape and have eternal life so when I found this was true and this was the truth that I was like so in shock and devastated and this is the ultimate red pill and it's the truth is not an easy pill to swallow which is why the Bible states that narrow is the path that leads to life and few will find it most people don't want to believe in sin or hell even people who claim to be Christians they don't want to accept this as true the type of Christianity that is politically correct and popular is all inclusive it accepts all of the religions as being acceptable paths to salvation and it puts no limits on sin and the desires of this world and this is a lie from Satan Jesus is not an enlightened master and he is not just the son of God Jesus is God Jesus told His disciples I'm the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me so in Ephesians 6:12 it states we do not wrestle against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this age against spiritual hosts of wickedness in heavenly places and what this is saying is that the real enemy is not people it's Satan and his demon army army and Satan is using the most powerful people the richest most powerful people to bring about his Antichrist system to bring forth the Antichrist and the Beast system which will be a global one-world government and one of the tactics used to achieve this goal is through mass reduction of the world's populations it's a form of eugenics and the humanitarians and philanthropists of the world like Bill Gates they are all you Genesis and they are working together to lower the population because they believe that's the way that they are going to save the earth and some of the ways that they are doing this is through genetically modified food spraying the skies with chemtrails abortion and reproductive services vaccinations which cause brain injuries and sterilization subpar medical services Wars and biological weapons like manufactured viruses that will become global pandemics these people are responsible for the release of this current virus and I'm not going to say the name of the virus on this video because I don't want it to be flagged and this is a classic Hegelian dialectic tactic which is problem reaction solution so they have created the problem they know the reaction that they want from us which is panic and fear and they will push their solution which is the New World Order and it's a globalist agenda so right now the world is currently under a mass trauma-based mind control experiment the intense fear that is being pushed on us by our governments and media is causing people to panic and not think rationally or critically their solution to the chaos that they are creating themselves will be increased laws that restrict our freedoms such as forced vaccinations increased surveillance implanted identification chips and a digital currency so these people are just puppets to Satan they're being used by Satan and they don't even know it just like I was used by Satan before and didn't know it and sain wants us to feel powerless and victimized but the Bible says that those who follow Christ are filled with the Holy Spirit and that we have power and authority over the kingdom of darkness and saying himself Jesus States behold I've given you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing will injure you the best thing that you can do right now is to not buy into the fear that they are pushing on us and we can do this by arming ourselves with truth Hosea 4:6 says my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge proverbs 11 9 but through knowledge shall the just be delivered Jesus is the ultimate truth and the Holy Spirit is our comforter if you have not already given your life to Jesus Christ now is the time to do so you must repent ask God to forgive you for your sins and we are all sinners because God is the only righteous and perfect being we must put all of your trust in the Lord it is only through Jesus that we have access to everlasting life and when we know where we are going once we die then death has lost its sting God is ready to do something mighty on this earth we just need to be praying for justice peace and faith I believe in an awakening is taking place right now and we will see science and miracles that go beyond anything that we have ever dreamed for the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob is the god of the impossible I'll be posting more videos going into deeper analysis of the topics covered in this video I'm looking forward to sharing more with you all please subscribe to my youtube channel Lily Hubbard and if you enjoyed this video give a thumbs up which just helps the algorithm thank you all so much god bless you,1
426,[Music]  [Music]  all right we're out on race today so please bear with gunfire here in the background today we're talking about the 10 millimeter Auto sum of its pluses and minuses and specifically how does it stack up next to a 45 ACP well there's a lot of different handguns available in both calibers so to account for as many extraneous variables as possible the guns I'm going to use are the Glock model 21 and caliber 45 acp and the Glock model 20 in ten millimeter these two handguns are of extremely similar size and weight and the only significant difference being the caliber now before I go any farther I want to say that a lot of people have asked to see a presentation on the 10 millimeter and because of donations to the patreon account I was able to purchase this 10 millimeter so thank you everybody so let's shoot the 10 mu meters side-by-side with the 45 and see how they compare and see if the pluses of the 10 outweigh the minuses the 10 millimeter has a reputation for being very powerful is it well let's see if we can shed some light on that got the chronograph set up at 7 yards and I'm going to start by shooting the 45 now I've got this loaded with Remington green and white locks 45 ACP 185 grain metal case Remington calls it metal case I'll see what kind of velocities I get with the 45 and then see how the 10 millimeter compares  1029 1024 1015 1022 and 968 now let's see how the 10-millimeter compares now I've got the 10 millimeter loaded with Remington green and white box 10 millimeters 180 brain metal case so let's see how we do  1115 1112 1109 1104 1121 now let's go crunch the numbers our 45 ACP has a 185 grain bullet and the 10 millimeter has a 185 grains difference I think we can live with the mean velocity of the 45 is 1011 while with the 10 millimeter is 1112 a net gain of 101 feet per second I'd say that's significantly more but this stuff is targeting ammunition how about some serious carry ammunition well I've got Sig Sauer elite performance and again our 45 is a 185 grain bullet and our 10 millimeter is 180 let's see how these compare and with our elite performance a mo will again start with a 45  1005 1035 1012 998 1036 now let's see how that comparison 10-millimeter and now we'll try the elite performance 10-millimeter 1230 1202 1220 1231 1243 let's go crunch those numbers now with our elite performance animation 45 ACP has a 185 grain jacketed hollow point and we've got a mean velocity of 1017 feet per second that's not that but with our 10 millimeter and it's 180 grain jacketed hollow point we're going to mean velocity of 1225 that's two hundred and eight feet per second more than the 45 ACP so to the question is the 10 millimeter powerful yes is it more powerful than a 45 yes significantly so but that also brings up the question will that greater power give you greater recoil yes I could feel more recoil but to what degree will that greater recoil negatively affect accuracy especially if you're trying to shoot multiple targets quickly well let's see if we can put that to the test now I've got 9 knock down plates set up at 7 yards I'll shoot 1 through 9 do a magazine change during which 1 through 6 will come back up and then I'll shoot them for a total of 15 shots and I'll start with the 45 then I'll repeat that with the 10 millimeter and we'll see to what degree does it's greater recoil slow me down  now let's see how that compares to the 10 and now let's try the 10 any difference and if so was it enough to matter now we'll get back to shooting in a few minutes but right now fair warning this is the boring part of the presentation where I talk and what I want to talk about is that when you have a discussion of the 10 millimeter it seems inextricably linked to a discussion of the case of the late Harald fish now I've done some research on this and it comes with the normal caveats the source materials don't always agree with each other and I'm trying to give you the very short version of a very long story but basically it goes like this Harald fish lived in Arizona he went out for a day hike in the woods news carrying a ten millimeter pistol at the end of his hike when you return to his vehicle he was so he claimed accosted by two dogs he fired a warning shot into the ground and that solved his dog problem but he was then charged by the man who was with the dogs he was forced to shoot in self-defense hitting his assailant three times in the chest mortally wounding him fish rendered first-aid saw help the paramedics and the police arrived this made a statement to the police well shortly thereafter under some political and social pressure the district attorney decided to charge fish with second-degree murder fish was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to ten years in prison he served three years after which his conviction was overturned and his case led to some changes in Arizona law now again I'm giving you the very short version of this one of those changes was it shifted the burden of proof away from a citizen having to prove their claim of self-defense was legitimate to the state having to prove that claim wasn't legitimate and that's the way that criminal prosecutions are supposed to work now there are a lot of people who will posit the opinion that Harold Fisk was fraudulently charged for the crime well I wasn't there but based on what I could learn about this that is an opinion I would tend to agree with however there's also people who will say that he was fraudulently charged based solely on the fact that he had a 10-millimeter and that's just not correct there was a lot more stuff involved in it than that such as he had given some conflicting reports of what happened and some of the things he said were contradictory to what other people had said for example he said this happened at 6:30 while someone who was some distance away but heard the gunfire said that it happened at 5:30 there was also the fact that the coroner or medical examiner gave some very damning testimony and among that was he testified that of the shots that entered the thoracic cavity Warren had already passed through the decedent's hand I don't know where and that that definitively showed that the decedent was in a surrender position not an attack position also the angle of the wound channels showed that the decedent was standing still not coming forward as fissioned claimed well I didn't see the autopsy report but I find assertions like that that something proves that someone's in a defensive position not just getting ready to hit you with with an open hand or any defensive position not coming at you to strangle you or that someone was standing still not moving forward I find conclusions like that to be dubious at best now in looking at all of this and again I haven't seen all the information but based on what I do know I'm of the opinion that it is very unlikely that fish committed a crime at all and because he didn't commit a crime there is very little evidence to show that he did and so a district attorney under some political and social pressure to get a conviction to bootstrap a very weak case and he did that in several ways among that was trying to exclude what many people would consider very important exploratory evidence for example there were several people ready to testify that the decedent in this case had been aggressive and combative and violent on previous occasions but he accosted several people but the district attorney successfully petitioned the court to exclude that evidence and so the jury didn't get to hear a lot of that now what this has to do with a 10-millimeter is another thing the district attorney did was he tried to vilify fish for having a ten millimeter pistol saying that this pistol was more powerful than what the police had and because it was loaded with hollow-point ammunition that demonstrated that fish was violent and obviously wanted to kill somebody okay so what can we take away from all of this well a few things one of which is in cases like this the people whose job it is to investigate these things such as the police and the people whose job it is to decide whether or not you're going to be prosecuted and then prosecute you in like the District Attorney's Office those people approach these investigations with their education their experience their knowledge their wisdom but they are human beings and sometimes they can also bring with them their lack of experience their ignorance their prejudices their bigotries and sometimes their political agendas and quite often things that absolutely should not matter end up mattering things like did you shave that day what were you wearing and your choice of firearms and ammunition and anybody who's ever been the victim of gender bias or racial bigotry knows exactly what I'm talking about but specifically about a ten millimeter there's a couple of things we can take away from this two of those being one if you own a 10-millimeter or you're planning on buying one I would really recommend that you appoint yourself with the details of the case of the late Harold fish because if you're discussing a 10-millimeter it's very likely his name is going to come up another thing is if you are in the process of deciding whether or not you want to buy a 10-millimeter you should make that decision based on are you buying a good quality firearm does it fit your hand does it fit your needs does it fit your budget and the list goes on but there are a large number of people out there who are for lack of a better term bigoted against the ten millimeter and that's something I think you should take into consideration too so all that having been said let's get back to shooting now here's some 3a body armor and here is you we know 3a body armor will stop the projectiles from calibers like 9 by 1947 Wesson 45 ACP when those are fired from what would be considered stereotypical hands on length barrels but what about a 10 millimeter well I've got my 10 millimeters loaded with four rounds two of the Remington green and white box 180 grain metal case and two of the Sig Sauer elite performance 180 grain jacketed hollow-point and I'll shoot this from seven yards and we'll see what happens now a lot of times even if this body armor stops the bullet there's enough concussion to crack that soda bottle so if you see soda leaking reserve judgment until after we do the neck rocks  the body armor did stop the bullet but there was enough concussion that it chewed up this one soda bottle pretty badly so I'll set this up again with a higher quality duct tape and then let's see what happens well three things one it stopped the bullet too even if the three a body armor can stop the bullet it looks like the 10 millimeter can still do a lot of damage and three it looks like this advanced level duct tape wasn't quite as advanced as I'd hoped for let's try one more shot and here's the three shots we fired our two hollow points in our one metal case round so in the contest of three a body armor versus 10 millimeter pistol I've got to declare the three a body armor the winner marginally now this is the point in the presentation a lot of you have been waiting for where we shoot the meat target in fact I'm going to bet some of you have fast forwarded to this part but in shooting the meat target with a 10 millimeter we have to approach that differently than we would with other handgun calibers because a lot of people not only have a 10 for home defense or something like that but they carry a 10 millimeter in the field for protection against lions tigers bears oh my and so we had to come up with a meat target that would be representative of that now if you were being attacked by an animal as it's coming toward you you'd probably shoot it in the front but in a lot of hunting scenarios it's very typical to shoot a lateral thoracic shot that you want to pass through both lungs so the meat target we have today is our double lung meat target and we've got ribs on both sides but their beef ribs not pork ribs beef ribs are a lot more robust than pork we do have our pig ear skin and then over that our leather jacket skin this animal has a thick hide and behind that as always the high tech police bullet stop now there's two questions we want to answer one is the 10 millimeter going to be effective and the other is is it really going to be significantly more effective than 45 ACP well we'll start with the 45 and I've got it loaded with the Sig Sauer elite performance 185 grain jacketed hollow-point so I'll shoot from 7 yards and we'll see what happens  effective I'd say so bullets went through the ribs where they hit the ribs broke them pulverized our lung tissue but we see a big loss in energy our second watermelon lung doesn't have near as much damage and all of the projectiles were stopped by the ribs on the back they didn't even penetrate the plastic wrap the ribs come in a couple of the projectiles lost their jacket one of those jackets was stuck in this second watermelon now let me show you a close-up of them here's a couple of projectiles that hit the ribs and they're just mangled here's the jacket one of them one stayed intact and the expansion looks really good now we'll try the ten millimeter with the Sig Sauer relief performance 180 grain jacket  effective again I'd say yes first let me show you a close-up of the bullets so like the 45 hour 10 millimeter bullets are mangled one lost its jacket and the jacket was stuck in the second water going and one stayed intact and expanded very well so our 10 millimeter projectiles went through the ribs on the front where they hit a rib shattered it destroyed our first watermelon we see greater retention of energy than the 45 had and more damage to our second watermelon but still all the projectiles were stopped by the ribs on the fact they were just barely stuck in there so it was the 45 effective yes was the 10 millimeter more so yeah maybe a little bit but let me show you one other thing now I'm going to shoot the meat target with 45 acp Winchester white box 230 grain Full Metal Jacket round nose now let's see what kind of penetration we get so how do we do the 45 ACP Full Metal Jacket well the bullet went through the ribs on the front didn't do a lot of damage to our first watermelon even though it has four pretty well centered hits did a lot more damage to the second watermelon this is where the bullets are starting to tumble all of the projectiles hit the ribs on the back penetrated them where a bullet hit a rib shattered it went through the leather jacket hide on the back and then they were all stopped by the first layer of fleece so it would appear that although 45 ACP hollow points are good and 10 millimeter hollow points even more so when it comes to getting complete penetration on what would represent a large animal plain old 45 acp 230 grain hard ball is hard to beat and it looks like it can also be pretty effective and there you have it and of course I could have gone on for days but I was trying to be concise so what are the real takeaways from this well first is the 10 millimeter powerful yes is it more powerful than a 45 yes is it more powerful than a locomotive been able to leap the tallest buildings in a single bound no and that power comes at a price in several ways first literally these two boxes of ammunition purchased at the same store on the same day the 45 was $19.75 the 10 millimeter was 22 75 $3 more that won't break the bank but these two boxes of ammunition again purchased at the same or on the same day the 45 was $27 the 10-millimeter was $37 that's a big difference there's also a price difference in the guns very commonly you go to a gun store and you see two pistols of similar make and model one to 10 millimeter 1 to 45 the 10 millimeter is more expensive there's also the matter of availability it's very common to go to a gun store and they'll have a pretty good selection of 45s and they won't have any 10 millimeters and that goes with the ammo as well I can go to buy Mart Walmart whatever and find 45 ammo any day of the week 10 millimeter not so much and it's not rare but it's just not as common as 45 and there aren't as many varieties of 10 millimeter as there are a 45 animal then there's the matter that although the 10 millimeter is more powerful there's some types of 45 ACP plus P and they're not all created equal but there are some 45 plus P rounds that really narrow that power gap but then those come with the downside of there's certain 45 pistols in which the + PM will just shouldn't be used so you've got pluses and minuses with both calibers there's also a social stigma attached to both of these and we talked about the 10 millimeter a little bit earlier if you have a 10 millimeter some people will assume you're a criminal and you'll also make all of those people that have 40 Smith & Wesson's reading envious of you but then if you have a 45 ACP people will assume you were born in 1911 t12 so again both calibers have the real pluses and minuses and the real bottom line is of course that no one can decide what's right for you except you and hopefully you'll do that with some good input and I would hope this was good input so as always don't try this at home on what you call a professional and thanks for watching the 10 millimeter versus 45 video [Music],1
239,"tonight's talk this is the most popular talk we've ever done in 15 years tonight is the third so it's been a weekend of Jordan Peterson rich with has been a huge pleasure for anyone who doesn't know him and last night I think it was one babe in arms and tonight it's probably my mother he is a was a professor associate professor at Harvard University and is now the professor of clinical psychology at Toronto his first book was a huge success it revolutionized the psychology of religion and his latest book of the 12 rules of life is set to do exactly the same just a few housekeeping things at the end of the talk we're going to have a Q&A which I'm going to moderate so do prepare your questions please make them questions and also for those people in the livestream there'll be posted notes and you can't hand questions for the ushers and we'll be taking those as well so I look forward to that and at the end of it we're going to be doing not so much as signing but here on stage a dedication everyone's book is or pretty but everyone's book is already signed so if you want to if you don't want a dedication then just leave you on the third page you'll find the signature in order to last night there was a huge queue as you can imagine in order to make the queue run smoothly and sorry to sound bossy but he's not going to be doing selfies  just because it means he's got a stand up the whole time and it'll slow down the flow but he is very happy to be photographed and you can photobomb him if you'd like  also because all of us particularly me are really keen for him to solve the problems of our lives please resist doing that during the dedication because it'll really slow everything down I think the three things that you can take away from this evening and you'll be the judges first of all be inspired by the talk secondly read the book and thirdly marry a Canadian I feel rather fortunate to have now done all three also if you would like to tweet its hashtag the rules of 12 rules of life so without further ado please welcome one of the world's great public intellectuals Jordan Peterson thank you [Applause]  [Applause] well that was nice so I thought I'd I talk about my book tonight um I give him two talks now and I didn't actually talk directly about it I sort of talked around it and so I thought I don't like to give the same talk twice so I thought I'd actually walked through it and and and outline it a little bit and so I had to spend most of the day memorizing the rules you know you'd think if you worked on something for three years or it's been five years I guess he'd actually have it memorized but memory is a very strange thing and it's it's very particular and goal-oriented and I actually didn't have the rules memorized it's certainly not their numbers so hopefully I do by now so I guess we're gonna find out but I have a copy of the book here in case I in case I forget so I think we'll go through them one by one and we'll see how see how that goes seven o'clock so all right good the first rule which is kind of a comical rule is stand up straight with your shoulders back and it's a meditation among other things on the habits of lobsters I read some papers on lobsters well must be ten years ago I guess and it they just absolutely blew me away and one of the things I've really loved about being a psychologist there's many things but I've really loved psychoanalytic theory and and the great clinicians the behaviorists as well I mean Freud Jung addler Carl Rogers Abraham Maslow that behaviors like Skinner and and and the cognitive behaviors I mean I've learned a tremendous amount from reading the clinicians and so if any of you are interested in psychology I would really recommend reading the great clinicians because they know they've learned so much about life it's crazy by reading them so that's been fun but then on the entirely other end of the spectrum where I've learned most about psychology is from the really low what would you call them the really science oriented animal behaviors that's where they would they turned into the neuroscientists right they were the animal behaviorists first of all and then they turned into the neuroscientists I've learned a tremendous amount from them there's such clear thinkers the best of the bunch I think there's two of them one named Jeffrey gray who wrote a book called the neural psychology of anxiety which is just a deadly book it's impossible to read it takes like six months to read it because I think he he read like 1,800 papers to write it or something like that and he actually read them that's the cool thing and he understood them which is really something then there's another guy named yak panksepp who wrote a book called how affective neuroscience which outlines his studies for example of rats he was the guy who learned that rats laugh if you tickle them with the end of a pencil eraser but they laugh ultrasonically like bats so you have to salute you have to slow down the ultrasonic vocalizations before you can hear them giggle and you think why the hell when you spend your time tickling rats with a pencil and making them laugh but see what he demonstrated there was that that there was a play circuit in mammals that there's an actual there's a psycho biological basis for rough-and-tumble play for example it's a bloody big deal you know discovering a whole new circuit in the brain that's like discovering a continent it's Nobel prize-winning stuff and panksepp so effective neuroscience I would highly recommend that so there's this other book I know about - which is twelve rules for life which you could also look into if you want anyways I was reading these these articles on lobsters and I came across this finding that lobsters lobsters governed their postural flexion with serotonin and I thought god that's so interesting it's so in deflection is this is to stand up straight hey wow that's so interesting because you know depressed people crouched over I wonder if there's any link between those two things and then I went and read a whole pile of papers on lobster lobster neural chemistry lobster neuro chemistry is actually quite well understood because they have a fairly simple nervous system right and so if you want to understand a complex nervous system it's a good idea to understand a simple one first and then sort of elaborate upwards and it turns out that serotonin governs status it governs status emotional regulation and posture in lobsters just like it does in human beings and so that would just blew me away and so one one one thing that the chapter one is about is the fact that if a lobster is defeated in a dominance battle you can give it essentially antidepressants and it will fight again I now that just blew me away you know it's so it's so remarkable because one of the things that tells you is that so if you're a debate imagine that you could be lobster top dog or bottom dog imagine there's 10 strata in the lobster hyrax and so you could be number one right top lobster number 10 bottom lobster if your bottom Lobster you have low serotonin levels than high octopamine levels that's the neurochemical that human beings don't produce and if you're a top lobster you have high serotonin levels and lower top amine levels and you can move a lobster in its dominance hierarchy by moderating its levels of serotonin and I thought that's so interesting because what it means is that the counter that keeps track of our status we have a counter in the sense in our minds that keeps track of our status is a third of a billion years old and what that also means is that the the idea of the hierarchy let's call it a dominance hierarchy because it within lobsters it's kind of like a physical prowess hierarchy something like that the idea of the hierarchy is at least 350 million years old and so I read that and I think well so much for the idea that human hierarchies are a socio-cultural construct it's like no that's wrong it's not just a little bit wrong it's unbelievably wrong it's mind-boggling ly wrong right and it's right and so so hierarchies hierarchies have been around for a third of a billion years and and we have a neurochemical system that modulates our our understanding of those hierarchies and then also and this is the interesting thing too and this is why people's reputations are so important to them among there's lots of reasons but this is one of them is that where this counter that you share with lobsters rates you in terms of your hierarchical position determines the ratio of negative emotion to positive emotion that you feel and that's also an absolutely mind-boggling idea for two reasons one is it tells you why it's so hard on people to be put down because it doesn't just upset them in the moment it changes the way their entire system responds to the world so that they now experience more positive emotion and less than eight less negative emotion so that's really rough and then there's a corollary to that too which is like there's a very tight relationship between your belief system and your dominance hierarchy position it's complicated but it's worth going through like let's say that so I have a certain amount of status as a professor and and and I have the let's call it the what would you say I've been granted the entitlement to a certain position in a in a social hierarchy now the question is why do I have a valid claim to that position and the answer hypothetically is because I know enough so that my claim to the position is valid so then if you stand up in the audience and challenge my beliefs and show that I'm wrong you might you might say well I get upset because I'm wrong but the more accurate reason that I get upset is because you're indicating to the crowd that my my position in the hierarchy of authority is invalid and by doing that you lower me in the hierarchy and you mess around with the neurochemical systems that are regulating my emotions and so if you're interested at least in part in why people are so prone to defend themselves and their beliefs in the service of their position then that's why and so that's a great example of how you can learn these unbelievable things by stumbling across a rather obscure biological fact it's just it's just what would you say it it's like it's like a series of dominoes and and that's also why biological facts are so useful it's like we don't have to argue about whether or not haha social hierarchies as I said or or hierarchies are social constructs a given hierarchy is influenced in its structure by socio cultural conditioning let's say but the fact of the hierarchy so like the part of your brain that detects and regulates your response to hierarchies is older than the part of your brain that recognizes trees like it's old it's really really fundamental and so and almost all social animals organize themselves and social in hierarchies because now the other thing that chapter one is a bit of a meditation on what might constitute a hierarchy one of my business colleagues a former student of mine from Harvard very very smart guy it's got a graduate degree in engineering from MIT and a PhD in psychology from Harvard so there's like one of him in the whole world and he's a very smart guy and he helped me design the self authoring suite by the way and he's been working for about 20 years on that that's the suite of programs that helps people write about their lives and straighten them out he told me to stop using the word dominance hierarchy and he said the reason for that was that it was infested with Marxist presuppositions and it really bothered me when he first said that because I've been using the word for years dominance hierarchy he said we had a discussion about that he said well it's predicated on the idea that you climb up the hierarchy human hierarchy as a consequence of the expression of power it's like that's wrong you climb up valid hierarchies as a consequence of the expression of competence and that's actually technically right he was exactly the right person to tell me that because he had done his PhD on what predicts success in Western hierarchies and the answer is quite clear general cognitive ability some prefrontal ability as well which was what he specifically tested so intelligence roughly speaking although it's a little bit more elaborate than intelligence but that's close enough and trait conscientiousness accounts for about 50 percent of the variance in long term success and you think well hey how do you want your society be structured it seems pretty good to me that smart hardworking people are the ones most likely to succeed that's not a bad empirical test of the validity of a structure you know especially given how much vagary there is in life lots of random things happen to people but it's better to be born three standard deviations above the mean in intelligence in the West and it is to be born three standard deviations above the mean in wealth in relationship to where you'll end up when you're 40 so he said to use the word competence hierarchy or we decided that I think that's much better so chapter 1 is a bit of a meditation on the nature of hierarchies in the biochemistry of hierarchy but it's also an injunction about how to present yourself because you don't you want to present yourself to the world in a manner that that doesn't disgrace you in some sense that that might be a good way to think about it and you don't want to disgrace yourself because the consequence of disgrace is its emotional dysregulation more pain less positive emotion and so the best way to present yourself is to stand up forthrightly and to stretch out you know and to occupy some space and to to to you make yourself sort of vulnerable by doing that because you open up the front of your body right but it's a sign of confidence and that way people are most likely to give you the benefit of the doubt and that's a good way to start regulating your mood but not only does it directly regulate your mood just stand up because it's so tightly associated like posture reflection is associated with serotonin and emotional regulation but also because if you straighten up and you present yourself in that manner then other people are more likely to take you seriously and that means they'll start treating you as if you're a number one lobster instead of a number ten lobster and that's another way that you can at least give yourself the bloody benefit of the doubt right and and and and and and and confront the world in a courageous manner and that's a really good way of also of of figuring out how to establish yourself in multiple competence hierarchies because one of the general rules of thumb about how to be successful is to confront things that frighten you forthrightly and with courage and that's kind of a universal strategy for success and so that's what the first chapter is about so that's quite fun my graduate students I told them these lobster stories a my graduate students when we used to go out for breakfast and they were very competitive Bunch very fractious and witty and they were always trying to get one over on each other a hundred making some witty put down or something like that and it got to the point in the restaurants where they put their claws in the urns click like this when they you know got one over on one of their colleagues which was very peculiar and strange and very funny as well so so that's rule number one rule number two is uh treat yourself like you're someone that you care about and that that's a deeper chapter I would say like chapter one is kind of comical but it's also got this serious scientific end for example and it's practical like most of the rules are chapter two is a bit of a meditation on why see I read this I read this site this piece of work by young a long while back and it was a meditation on the injunction to treat your neighbor as as you would like to be treated something like that and what Jung pointed out which I really liked was that that wasn't an injunction to be nice to other people it was an invitation to reciprocity it was something like this is like you should figure out how you would like to be treated like you were taking care of yourself not how you would like people to respond to you it's more important than that it's like imagine you had a child that you really cared for and someone said well people will treat this child exactly like you want them to but you have to figure out what that is and so then you'd have to sit down for like a month and you think okay well how do you want your child to be treated you don't want everyone just to be nice to him you know you want people to challenge him and you want people to discipline him and you want people to tell him when he's wrong it's like you don't just want everyone to be nice that's that's pathetic it's pathetic isn't there's no challenge in that and so well you want to treat other people like you would like to be treated well then you have to figure out how would you like to be treated and while you'd like people to fawn all over you and just lay everything at your feet it's like no that's not something you'd wish for for someone that you were taking care of and then then there's an additional problem which is it's often the case that people will treat other people better than they treat themselves that happens extremely frequently so one of the things I pointed out chapter 2 was that if you have a dog and you take him to a vet and the vet gives you your prescription medicine you'll go buy the medicine and you will give it to the dog and you will do it properly but if you go yourself to a doctor and you get a prescription there's one that there's a 30% chance you won't even pick up the medication and if you do there's a 50% chance that you won't administer it to yourself properly and so I really thought about that when I first came across that statistic it really it was another one of those little facts I thought what the hell's up with that it's like you'll do it for your dog so obviously you'll do it for something you care about and you're conscientious enough so you'll actually do it so like why wouldn't you do it for you your dog likes you you know even your dog would rather that you did but but you don't you don't and and it's actually one of the reasons that modern medicine doesn't nearly as well as it could because people just don't take their medication and it's not only because they don't take care of themselves there's some skepticism about doctors but you could be just as skeptical about the vet so it's a deep meditation I would say and it's what I've done with these rules is they're very simple rules and they're kind of comical and tongue-in-cheek in some ways but what I've tried to do is like pull them apart and show what's underneath them and to go down as deep as I possibly can and in rural - it's a bit of a meditation on why people don't like themselves very much and I think there's two reasons really and one is that we're we're fragile and damageable and imperfect in multiple dimensions all the time and that often just gets worse it gets lots of things get worse as you get old for example so it's not necessarily that easy for a self-conscious being who's extraordinarily aware of his or her own fragility and but not just fragility foolishness and errors his like you know yourself better than anyone else knows you and you know you you might have a certain amount of dislike for someone you know because of something they did but you know everything you did Jesus that's a drag man you know you have to carry that along behind like really I did that you know and then so there's that it's like you're you're weak and kind of useless and prone to temptation and you know all those things you know that just shouldn't be that way and then you're also capable of pretty vicious acts of malevolence and so you also know that about yourself and so it's a real existential question for people's like why the hell should you take care of something as sorry and wretched as you are and that's really what the chapter is about it's because the answer in the chapter is yeah yeah yeah you know you're first of all yes you're pretty useless and terrible but so is everyone else and that's actually an existential problem right and what I mean by that it's a problem that every human being has always had and always will so it's not just you it's a universal problem and that there's there's an answer to that and one of them is - what is it - say love the sinner but hate the sin it's something like that is that despite the fact that you're not all that you could be the proper attitude to have towards yourself is the attitude that you would have towards someone that you Jen only cared for and that it's incumbent on you to act as if you genuinely care for yourself just like you would act towards someone that you actually cared about some other person and so it's a reversal in some sense of the golden rule right and and it's a discussion of why that's necessary and also more than that it's a discussion of why why you have a moral obligation to do that it's not just that you should because it would be better for you it's you actually have a moral obligation to do that I think because you make the world a much better place it much worse place if you don't take care of yourself so you should bloody well take care of yourself you know because well that's what the chapters about it's partly because you have something valuable to bring into the world that's the thing about being an individual it's the thing that Western civilization has always recognized that as an individual you have a light that you have to bring into the world and that if you don't bring it into the world the world is a dimmer place and that's a bad thing because when the world is a dim place it can get very very very dark and so it's  necessary number one lobster now none of those things you need to take care of yourself because you're in the best position to do that and it's necessary for you to take care of yourself despite the fact that we're mortal and vulnerable and self-conscious and capable not only capable of doing terrible things but actually do them despite all that you you're still you still have that responsibility and so I wanted to you know hit the question as hard as I can to try to figure out well why people are have our contemptuous of themselves and there's plenty of reason that's for sure but the reasons do not justify the mistreatment of yourself it's as simple as that it's not a good strategy and the next rule is make friends with people who want the best for you and that's a meditation on my own childhood and adolescence to some degree I had friends who wanted the best for me and friends who didn't and you know they were friends who some of them were aiming up and some of them were aiming down and if you have a friend that's aiming down and you do something that's aiming up then they're generally not that happy about it you know they try to top your accomplishment with one of their own hypothetical or real or put down what you're doing or offer you a cigarette if you're trying to quit and you've kind of done that successfully or a drink if you've been drinking too much and are trying to stop being an alcoholic you know or or yeah they're cynical and bitter and and devoted towards no good and sometimes that's family members too and sometimes it's even part of you you know but this chapter is an injunction to people is like like you have an ethical responsibility to take care of yourself you have an ethical responsibility to surround yourself with people who have the courage and and faith and wisdom to wish you well when you've done something good and to stop you when you're doing something destructive and if your friends aren't like that then they're not your friends and maintaining your friendships with them might not even be in their interest and so it's a tricky argument to make because I'm not saying you know whenever anyone's in trouble you should you know push them into a ditch and then give them a couple of kicks that's that's not the idea the idea is that but I had a couple of rules I didn't write about one was be careful be careful about whom you share good news with and another was be careful about whom you share bad news with and everyone those rules ring in people's minds quite quickly a friend is someone you can share good news with you know you go to them and you say hey look this good thing happened to me and they say look I'm so happy that that happened to you like way to be and they don't think god damn it why didn't that happen to me and like you know you didn't deserve it here's a bunch of reasons you're stupid and why it won't work it's like that's not helpful and so I would say like if people are you know what the other thing people are doing if they're trying to drag you down let's say is they're trying to see if you'll put up with it because they have this idea that maybe life isn't worth living and things aren't good and then if they can be smirch let's say to use an archaic term something that's pristine and good then they demonstrate to themselves that there is no true ideal and that there's no necessary reason to be responsible and to strive forward and so they usually which is a test case you know I'll just push you down into the low lobster bin and see how you respond and if you put up with it then yeah my cynicism is fully justified and so well that's Chapter three and it's a painful chapter because it also details the suicide of one of my friends which occurred over long period of time not the actual suicide but all the prodrome a--to it and so and it's get sick it's a contentious chapter number four is compare yourself to who you were yesterday not to who someone else is today and the reason I wrote doubt was because I had this client ten young clinical psychologists and I spent 20 hours a week for 25 years listening to people listening to people tell me about their lives you know and and those people were people who were just barely hanging on to the bottom of the world up to people who were so successful you can hardly believe it's like the entire gamut of people and and that's been absolutely fascinating it's like it's like being a clinical psychologist if you really listen is like being immersed in a Dostoyevsky novel all the time you know because it's amazing what people will tell you if you listen to them they are people are so interesting if you actually listen to them because they're so peculiar like they're like penguins or rhinoceroses and ostriches they're unlikely creatures and anyways with regards to to comparing yourself to who you were yesterday and not to who someone else is today um this old client of mine he was about 85 when he came to see me and he was a financier in a kind of a mathematical genius he made these little pendants out of a mathematical symbol for the most beautiful mathematical equation that was ever written he made them out of gold and he would hand those out and and he studies psychology as a young man and he introduced me to this concept that I didn't know about called the Pareto distribution which see I'd been taught as a psychologist that most human characteristics who are normally distributed right so most people were average and some people were extreme that that's a priori our normal distribution intelligence is like that and height there's more people of average height than very tall or very short and weight is like that and lots of things are normally distributed and psychologists tend to assume that everything is but they didn't creative products are distributed in a Pareto distribution and that's a whole different thing and it's really important to know this it's another fundamental fact the knowledge of which can sort of transform the way you conceptualize let's say the political landscape so here's an example of the Pareto distribution huh you know there's a rule of thumb that if you run a company that 20% of your employees do 80% of the work or the 20% of your customers are responsible for 80% of your sales or the 20% of them are responsible for 80% of the customer service calls same thing but that's not exactly the rule the rule is worse than that the rule is in a given domain the square root of the number of people operating in that domain do half the productive work so you think well you have ten employees three of them do half the work it's like yeah okay what if you have a hundred employees then ten of them do half the work what if you have a thousand employees well then it's thirty and if it's ten thousand employees then it's a hundred and this actually turns out to be a rather ironclad rule it applies across very very many situations it applies for example to the mass of stars and the size of cities so you can see how universal it is as a law ditz it's something like those that have more get more and those that have less get less that's the Matthieu principle right to those who have everything more will be given from those who have nothing everything will be taken away and the economists sometimes call that the Matthieu principle and so what what that lays out is a wolf world that's rife with inequality so you know you you hear this idea that I think it's the 85 richest people in the world have more money than the bottom 2 billion that's a Pareto distribution phenomena and you might say to hell with capitalism for producing that it's like sorry you got your diagnosis wrong it's a natural law it's no no matter what society you study you get a purrito distribution of wealth you get a preeto distribution of number of records recorded you get a preeto distribution of number of songs written or goals scored like any creative product has that characteristic and it's partly because as you start to become successful let's say people offer you more and more opportunities and as you start to fail people move away from you and you plummet and so okay so that's rough so what it is what it means is that there is always a landscape of inequality and I'm not we shouldn't do anything about it although I am saying that we don't know what to do about it that's the thing you know because you can modify the preeto distribution of wealth let's say but if you but we don't know how to do it without maybe disrupting the system so completely that it collapses which is what happened in the Soviet Union for example and in Mao's China they were trying at least in principle to adjust inequality but the cure was far worse than the disease and the the truth of the matter is we actually don't know technically how much inequality there has to be to generate wealth we can guess and you could say well there should be less and you might say well there should be more if you're left when you'd say less and if there if you're right we need to say well we'll just let the inequality flourish but we do know that it's inevitable and we also know that we don't know how to regulate it so there is inequality what that means is there's always gonna be people around that are better at something than you are and the and that's a that's a problem because you can get jealous and you can get bitter and you can get resentful and worse you can get hopeless you know because you look like look like I have this is friend of mine he told me something so funny he was he was decrying his his lack of success in the world and he compared himself to his roommate and he said you know his roommate his college roommate was doing much better than he was and his bloody roommate was Elon Musk it's like doing as well as Elon Musk well I mean you can see me it would take it rather personally because they were roommates and everything it wasn't like he was doing badly like he wasn't doing pretty damn well it's like I'm not as good as Elon Musk it's like yeah well you and like seven billion other people you know but but I thought it was instructive because oh yes you have to be careful who you compare yourself to now you can't just not compare yourself to others to successful people right because then you don't have anything they a map and one of the things I learned from you this was a cool thing I'm gonna make a real lateral move here young thought the book of Revelation was appended to the Bible because the Christ in the Gospels was too merciful he was too nice a guy now he's an ideal right and Young said wait a second an ideal is always a judge that's the thing about an ideal because you're not as good as your ideal so your ideal as a judge revelation has Christ coming back as a judge and that was Young's explanation at the level of the collective unconscious for the pasting of that remarkably strange and terrible book on to the end of the of the of the Bible so well anyways my point is is an ideal is it you need an ideal because you have nothing to aim at but an ideal is a judge and you always fall short of the ideal so how the hell can you have the benefits of having an ideal without having the crushing blow that goes along with having the judge that always regards you as insufficient so I was trying to work that out in the chapter and this is something I've had to work out a lot as a clinical psychologist it's like well let's say you need a goal but we don't want to eat let your distance from the goal crush you so you got to set up a goal and then you go to make the goal break the goal down into parts so that you can move towards it you have a fairly high likelihood of doing it so that's a bit a bit of practical I wouldn't say advice it's it's because it's better than advice it's it's some practical knowledge about how to go about achieving an aim set a high aim but differentiate it down so you know what the next step is and then make the next step difficult enough so you have to push yourself past where you are but but also provide yourself with a reasonable probability of success it's also what you do with children right you you want to push them because they need to grow up and be more than they are right but you don't want to crush them with constant failure so what you do is aim high and make the goal procs difficult but proximal so anyways so that's one one one one way of looking at it but then the next thing is you know I've had clients many clients in their 30s who are trying to this is more true with women I would say a lot of women who were very high achieving and who established their career goals at 30 and then want a differentiator differentiate out their life they want to have a husband they want to have a family they're trying to figure out how to do that and one of the things I've noticed that around 30 you really have to stop comparing yourself in some ways to other people and the reason for that is that the particular tease of your life or so a do synchronic that there isn't anyone really all that much like you you know because the details of your life happened to matter and so maybe you compare yourself to some rock star or something like that and you know the person is rich and famous and glamorous and all that but you know they're alcoholic and they use too much cocaine and they've had three divorces and it's like how the hell do you make sense out of that is that someone that you should judge yourself harshly against or not the answer is you don't know because you don't know all the details of their lives and who do you know that you can compare yourself to that's easy you yesterday so here's a good goal it's something like well aim high and I really mean that it's like we'll talk about that a little bit to aim high but use as your control yourself it's like so your goal is to make today some tiny increment better than yesterday and you can use better you can define better yourself this doesn't have to be some imposition of external morality you know you know where you're weak and insufficient where you could improve sake okay well this is what I'm like yesterday if I did this little thing things would be just an increment better and well that's a great thing because you get the ball rolling and incremental improvement is unstoppable you can actually implement it and it starts to generate purrito distribution like consequences it starts to compound and I've seen that happen in people's lives over and all on people writing all the time and tell me that they're doing that but I've seen that happen in people's lives continually they make a goal a goal that the goal should be how could I conceive of my life so that if I had that life it would clearly be worth living so I wouldn't have to be bitter resentful deceitful arrogant and vengeful like that's sort of the bottom line right because that's what endless failure does to you it's not good and and and that's what life without purpose and a goal does to you as well because life is very hard so you think okay well I need to adopt a mode of being that would justify my suffering and you can ask yourself that questions what would make this worthwhile need a quote Nietzsche I think in that chapter he said he who has a why can bear almost any how that's a lovely line man I mean it's a lovely line and it's really worth thinking about so you think well how do I manage this misery and suffering and futility it's like well I need to figure out what I would have to do in order to make that clearly worthwhile and so then you have your goal and then you think well I need to move towards that incremental II because I'm kind of useless and can only do so much and maybe not even that and but all I have to do is be a little bit better than my my miserable self yesterday and that'll propel you forward very rapidly and and you can succeed at it which is also really lovely because why not set yourself up for success you know because otherwise you droop around like a number-10 Lobster and you know that's just not good you get home pinche when that happens and it's not a good thing so that was that was chapter four chapter five cheese we're cruising along here chapter five is the one that I thought I would get in the most trouble for writing you know I figured people would be all over me for this and so far they haven't been but they still might be so and it's called do not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them and I thought that would be contentious first of all because people would think well I never just like my children it's like really really you know you're gonna really tell me that God you know and there's a more there's a more horrifying element to that too because as a clinical psychologist I've seen the full Freudian nightmare I can tell you that and you know I've seen families where it's like this is like the family members are standing in a circle let's say and each of them has their hands around each other's neck and they're squeezing hard enough to strangle the other person in 20 years and that's the family it's like and you know if you if you haven't met a family like that or well then you're not paying attention and there's a there's some reasonable possibility that you're actually in the family like that so the idea that parents can't dislike their children it's like god how naive can you get it's just that's just if you think that man you I don't even know where you start to straighten yourself out I could never dislike my children's like yeah well those are the people who produce the most monstrous children - I can tell you that so so and then there's this idea that Young had which I really love which is the idea of the shadow and you know it kind of got pop psychology and trendy it's sort of among the new-age types - but one thing I can tell you about Carl Jung is no matter what else someone might say about him he is absolutely not new agey if you read Carl Jung and you understand him and you're not terrified right to the depths of your soul you haven't understood a damn thing you've read and one of the things that you said about the shadow which is the dark side of humanity the dark side of each individual was that its roots reached all the way to hell and he meant something he meant something very specific both metaphysical and practical by that the metaphysical element was he meant hell literally and metaphysically but he also meant the more proximal kinds of Hell and so what he meant was that if you were able to understand your dark side then you would see in yourself a reflection of the behavior that was that was present at Auschwitz for example and that the reason that people don't take the dark side of themselves seriously at all and even confront the fact that it exists is because no one wants to see that reflected within them and no wonder like it's it's absolutely no wonder you also believe that that confrontation with the shadow was an inevitable barrier to enlightenment that there was no you know Joseph Campbell who is a popularizer of Jung to some degree has become well known for saying follow your bliss and and and you know Campbell learned virtually everything he knew from Jung but Jung that isn't what Jung said at all he said pursue what's meaningful and you'll encounter that which you least want to encounter and that's well that's the dragon right that's the dragon that hoards gold for example and the dragon is also something that lives inside you and it's not something that you take the encounter with lightly there are very old stories about this Egyptian story about the god Horus who was that Egyptian Savior in some sense and when he encountered evil even though he was a god he lost an eye in the battle and so that's that's the famous Egyptian I you know that everyone still knows about that's the Eye of Horus that was torn out by Seth who's the precursor to Satan and so and so it's it's it's no joke it's no joke back to children see I kind of knew this when I had my kids I already undergone that to some degree and and understood what it meant to be a bad person a terrible person and one of the things I knew that was that that manifested itself in families all the time tyrannical father overprotective mother more rarely overprotective mother tyrannical overprotective father tyrannical mother it's usually the other way around and the terrible pathological familial drama that Freud made much of in the early 20th century I had seen that in many many situations dismal brutal awful and I've seen parents punish their children and you can also take a page from Nietzsche if you really want to punish your children or anyone else if you have someone you're interested in punishing including yourself you don't you know to ever punish someone you really want to punish for doing something wrong because that's actually a bit of a relief to them you know that's the theme of Dostoyevsky's crime and punishment the murderer gets away with it and it's a relief to him when he gets caught it's like no if you really want to punish someone you wait till they do something good then you punish them because that'll teach them that's you maximize the hurt that way you decrease the probability that they'll ever do anything good again and I'll tell you man if you want to have a good relationship with someone that's one thing you don't do you open your bloody eyes and if they do something that you would like them to do again then you tell them how much you appreciated the fact that that happened and you hope that it replicates you know you see that's it if there's one thing you can take away from tonight's lecture that's that's an extraordinarily useful thing to know watch and when people do something that they should do more of say look I saw that you did this specific thing I saw that it took some effort here's what it meant here's here's how I observed it's like keep that up and man if you love someone you do that to them that's that's encouragement that's such a great thing so anyways back to children so I already knew that I was pretty decent monster by the time I had kids and I thought well my kid my kids little you know like a baby or two-year-olds like I'm horrible monster and so there's an uneven power problem here I better not let that child do thing that really makes me angry you know now you hear now and then you hear about something horrible that happens I when I was in Boston years ago I read about a woman who plunged her two-year-old daughter's arms into boiling water you think well how in the world did not happen it's like well you know she's probably hungover she probably just lost her job she was probably desperate in six different ways she probably didn't have any decent discipline at her disciplinary strategies for children she probably didn't have anyone helping her she was bitter and resentful and angry and the child misbehaved at exactly the wrong moment and like you're gonna be around your children a lot and so you might want to have it so that they don't misbehave at exactly the wrong moment because all kid all hell can break loose if they can and I didn't want that to happen so and I knew that it was easy for people to hate their children even though they mouth the words that they loved them all the time I saw very little evidence of that many situations and so one of the things you know you have a natural affinity for children and even more it may be a more powerful natural affinity for your own children so that's a good start but you don't want to set them up as an enemy against you you don't want to allow them to engage in the kind of hierarchical challenge that makes you irritable and resentful that's not a good idea and if the things they do make you dislike them the probability that they will make other people dislike them is extraordinarily high and so you can consult your own irritability and you can say look kid I used to tell my kids this you know when they were three or four I'd say look I'm not in a very good mood and I'm likely to be unreasonable so it'd be best if you'd go in your room and play for a while it's like I like you man you're a great kid but like get the hell out of here for a while you know and they were fine with that we've trained them already at that point to be able to go play by themselves in the room you know which is something a kid should be able to do anyways but but you need to know what sort of monster you are if you're gonna be a good parent and if you think oh I'm not a monster it's like oh yes you are you're just an unbelievably unconscious monster and that's actually the worst kind so and then the other thing about that chapter is there's an idea in it and it's an idea that I think's well supported by the relevant literature which is that your fundamental job as a parent especially of a child from zero to four is to make that child lÃ©a desirable socially so what you're you're a successful parent if when your child is for all sorts of other children want to play with him or her that's really the that's like if you want one marker of whether or not you've been successful that's it now some children are a lot harder to get along with than others and some children have a harder time playing and so I'm not saying that every parent who has a child that isn't popular at four is that fault for that I'm not saying that I'm saying the reverse which is you can be sure that you've been successful if your child is not popular exactly but desirable as a playmate and so then you think well what have you done for your child well you've opened up the entire world of children to them so because they know how to play which is a very deep knowledge and it starts to become inculcated probably at the breast and certainly in the course of rough-and-tumble play at about two years of age it's a deep embodied knowledge they know how to play like a good well-trained dog knows how to play you know you meet a new dog if you go like this and the door goes like this you think oh that dog I can go like this and it will bite me right it knows how to play and a kid who's awake and alert is just like that like a well socialized kid if you know anything about kids is you can take a four-year-old make a little play gesture at them and they'll smile right away and start playing just right now and that's what you want for your kids and then everywhere they go other kids like them and will include them in their play and play is the way the children develop and so if other children include them in their play then the children develop and the poor kids that don't get befriended at the age of four with the literature on this is crystal clear if your child is an outcast at the age of four the probability that anything can be done about that is almost zero no matter what you do and I hate to be so blunt about that but I know the literature and that's what the literature suggests and so and then the other thing is if if you don't allow your children to engage in dislikable behavior then adults will like them because adults actually like kids you know one of the things I loved about having little kids in Montreal I lived in a poor area and much well there's a lot of rough guys around there and we used to roll our daughter around in the stroller these rough guys you know like god only knows what they were up to there looking guys you know we roll our daughter by them and they'd they'd like smile and they crouch down and make little GU faces and you know they were you I tell you one of the great things about having little kids is they bring out the best in other people you see a whole side of humanity even among the darker parts of humanity you see a whole side of them that you wouldn't normally see and it's lovely and the thing is if you're good to your kid and in the real way you can help them maintain that tremendous attractiveness that they have as young children and to respond to adults properly like a puppy that wags its tail instead of growls and you know goes for your ankle and then wherever they go adults welcome them and teach them things and Pat them on the head and smile at them genuinely instead of saying oh my god here comes that couple with that goddamn brat again you know which is the horrible that's horrible thing to do to a child because then everywhere they go all the good all the good will is false you know there's nothing that you can do to someone that's more terrible than to put them in a world where all the good will directed towards them is false that's a terrible thing so anyways that's what chapter let's chapter 5 and chapter 6 is about it's a rough chapter it's about I spend a lot of time reading about totalitarianism and about atrocity like some brutal many many brutal things brutal beyond the capacity of imagination even and I read a lot about individual criminals and serial killers and those sorts of people too trying to get to the bottom off one book I would really recommend is a book by carl panzram which is a an autobiography panzram is the name of the book and he was a here's a rough guy man his whatever his dying words to his executioner to his hangman he said hurry up you who's your bastard I could kill ten men in the time that it takes you to hang me that was his dying words you know he said I wish the human race had one neck so that I could put my hands around it and squeeze that was carl panzram and not many people like that right out of biographies but he did and he told you why he was like that and why he thought that way in case you want to find out which I would recommend by the way cuz it's very useful to know such things but um  now I have to remember why I've told you that panzram story oh yeah chapter six is about that it's a boat it's a boat panzram and it's about the Columbine kids that kids who showed up the high school cuz I read their Diaries no and and I understood them too which is even better than just reading them and you know you can see these mass shootings all the time and everyone does the same thing oh how did that happen why did that happen how can it be this way it's like well why don't you read what they said about why they did just assume that that's the reason and if you go if you go oh other Columbine kids oh [Applause] yeah it's like oh they must have been bullied oh yes because you know the natural response of anyone who's been bullied is to go arm yourself to the teeth to plot the destruction of the entire city I think it was of Detroit to line your entire high school Avenue with bombs and then to go and shoot your classmates that's what happens when you're bullied it's like no that that's not what happens when you're bullied that's a stupid explanation it's shallow beyond belief and it and it really emerges only because people don't want to contend with the real issue and the Columbine kids while they were contending with the real issue you know they basically said quite forthrightly that in their own arrogant estimation being itself was corrupt and unnecessary and it would be best if it was eradicated in the most brutal possible way as fast as possible and you get to places like that if you dwell on revenge for three or four years in your mom's basement you know you can go to very dark places and so that's what chapter six is about and you know panzram who was very brutally treated when he was a kid and the Columbine guys who you know had their ups and downs but nothing compared to carl panzram say were we're judges of being and decided that it was flawed and that they were the ones to set it right and so it's a rough chapter but it's more than that it's a meditation on resentment because resentment is a key human motivation and I would say it's um it's a great teacher to to listen to your resentment is one of the best things you can possibly do you have to admit that it exists first and then you have to admit to the fantasies that it's generating and you have to admit to what you would regard as the way out of it so that's all very difficult because it means learning things about yourself that you probably don't want to learn but resentment only means one of two things it means either like shut the hell up grow up quit whining and get on with it that's one thing it means or someone is playing the tyrant to you might even be you and you have something to say and do that you should say and do to put it to a stop and so maybe and resentment can show you the pathway to doing that it's a meditation on resentment and one of the one of the principles that I extracted from that is a core essential person wants other people to change and if you're resentful then your motivations aren't trustworthy in fact they're very very dark and that's why I went to the extreme with people like pens around them the Columbine killers resentful people who want to change the world are not to be trusted what should you do instead how do you treat your own resentment I would say well there's a there's a great I read this great line in and TS Eliot play called the cocktail party and in it this woman comes up to a psychiatrist I think this is in this chapter and she says you know I'm having a really rough time of it I'm suffering badly my life is not going well and and then she says I hope that there's something wrong with me and the psychiatrist she says well here's how I look at it there's either something wrong with the world and I'm just in it and that's how it is and then like what am I going to do about that because it's the whole world or maybe I could be fortunate and there's something wrong with me that's causing all this unnecessary suffering and if I could just set it right I could learn and I could set it right and so well I've been thinking about that for a very long time and I think well if your life isn't going the way it is you know you can find someone else to blame which is pretty convenient for you and also relatively easy or you could think okay I don't like I don't like the way my life is unfolding maybe I don't like life in general because it's tragic and untainted with evil how do I know if my judgement is accurate and the question is well have I really done everything I possibly could to set my life straight because maybe I shouldn't be judging it it's quality or the quality of life itself or being itself for that matter if I haven't done everything I possibly could to set my life straight well so there's a there's a task Solzhenitsyn who I'm a great I'm a great admirer of social nets and his book The Gulag Archipelago was one of the things that brought down the Soviet Union and he said that one man who stopped lying could bring down the tyranny and you know he said that was some authority I think you could easily make the case that the Gulag Archipelago is the greatest book of the 20th century I mean there's other contenders obviously but he said when he was in the gulag camps you know meditating on how the hell he got there and he had a rough life man I mean first of all he was on the Russian front at the beginning of World War two and then he was thrown in the gulag camp and that was just the beginning of his adventures man he had a rough life he was in the camps he was thinking what the hell like how what how did I get here what's going on he had Hitler and Stalin to blame right so if you have if you need someone to blame man Hitler and Stalin that that's great but he he that isn't what he did he said he meditated for a while once he realized that he might have something to do with in some strange way with the way things turned out for him and he said he went over his life with a fine-tooth comb in his memory and thought okay where did I go wrong but by my own judgement when when when I when there was a path in front of me when did I take the path that I knew I shouldn't take because you all know that right you know sometimes you don't know if what you're doing is good or if it's bad it's just ignorance you just don't know but sometimes you bloody well know and you do the thing you know you shouldn't do anyways that happens a lot and why do you do that spiked is part of it it's stupidity there's all sorts of reasons but you certainly know you do it Solzhenitsyn thought okay well what would happen if I took responsibility for where I am in this call sensation camp and then I went over my whole life and tried to figure out all the things I did that were wrong by my own estimation that increased the probability that I would get here and then what would happen if I tried to set them all right now in the present and that's why he wrote the Gulag Archipelago and one of the consequences of that as I said was it sped the dissolution of the Soviet empire so hey that's not bad eh like you make a real confession you really repent you you do your penance which is writing this book and you completely change the geopolitical landscape of the world it's like and that that's worth thinking about because it's not only Solzhenitsyn who did that Nelson Mandela did something quite similar it's not so impossible and so the idea that what you should do if you're feeling resentful about the nature of being or suffering too much for your own life let's say is straighten the damn thing out like seriously try it for a year even try it for a week try not doing the things you know you shouldn't do try not saying the things you know to be false and just watch what happens you might as well give it a shot right because you say well I'm all in for a year you know I'm gonna do things right and then I'll just stand back and I kind of watch how things unfold and maybe I'll reconsider at the end of that year it's like try it try it I mean I would say I've had thousands of letters now from people who are saying hey I tried that you know and hey you know worked you know I quit lying and everything quick you ever see that Simpsons episode where Sideshow Bob keeps stepping on the rake over and over that's like the whole yard is littered with rakes and all he does is walk around and step on then curse steps on a rake and hit some in the face and he curse isn't any steps on another rake and it you know what I mean stop doing that  I don't know if we'll get through all 12 rules guess you'll have to read the damn book anyways rule 7 rule 7 just about killed me like I've had a lot of bad health in the last year and having to rewrite rule 7 coincided with one of those periods that lasted about a month and it was was the hardest chapter by far and it went down the deepest by far and it was really hard to get right it's called do what is meaningful not what is expedient and I'll just tell you a little bit about the chapter because I figured something out in it that and then explained it something that took me decades to figure out so there's this idea it's a it's a very deep Christian idea that the Messiah is the person who takes the world's sins upon himself right that's a characteristic of Christ right it's something the idea is something like Christ died for your sins like what the hell does that mean exactly you know and partly what it means and I would say a slightly corrupted form of Christianity is that you just have to believe that that happened in the and you're redeemed it's like well that's we'll leave that aside for a second but there's an idea there a psychological idea and you know that because the idea doesn't go away it's lasted for thousands of years it's like whoa so the idea signifies something it has a psychological reality independent of its metaphysical reality whatever that might be and so I thought about that for a long time it's like what in the world does that possibly mean and then I realized and you knew this Carl Jung knew this that it was associated with this idea of the shadow I had this client once who her parents man they were pieces of work she her parents taught her I'm swear to you that this is the truth her parents taught her that adults were angels literally and when I saw her she was about thirty and she had a lot of strange symptoms symptoms of sorts I'd never seen psychosomatic symptoms she she she had kind of like quasi epileptic seizures at night and no but she stayed conscious during them it was very difficult to understand at night I won't walk through it but her parents told her that adults were angels and and she was like 28 she had a university degree and and I said well did you ever wonder about that I said didn't you read any history and she said yeah what I'd read something about the terrible things that people did to each other and I would just compartmentalize it and that was actually the key that I used to unlock what was wrong with her which was eventually fixed and I won't go into that but but I said I gave her this book give her two books I gave her a book called the terror that comes in the night which is a book about about sleep paralysis and nightmares because I thought that was what might have be bothering her turned out that wasn't yet then I give her this other book called ordinary ordinary men and it's a great book it's a terrible book terrible dark book about about this police battalion that was moved into Poland during World War two after the Nazis had marched through and it was all made of middle-aged guys who weren't like victims of Nazi totalitarian propaganda when they were kids they were just you know burgeois middle class guys kind of like all of us let's say and they went to police Poland and they were going to have to do some terrible things essentially but their commander told them quite forthrightly that if being involved in wartime policing was too hard on them if they felt that it violated the more psychological violence they could just go back to policing in Germany and very few of them did be partly because they didn't want to abandon their comrades let's say they didn't want them to have to do the dirty work you know and they ended up they were normal policemen they ended up the sorts of people who could take naked pregnant women out into the middle of the field and shoot them in the back of the head that's how the book that's the culmination of their training it's very interesting to read about their training because they were absolutely sickened by what they learned to do like physically sick and vomiting shaking traumatized but they didn't stop and and if you want to know why then you can read the book and I said look read this book but don't bloody well compartmentalize it enough of that it's like read it like you're one of the damn policemen which is how you should read history like you read about Nazi Germany and you think well I'm Oskar Schindler I'd save the Jews it's like no you wouldn't right you wouldn't because people didn't and the probability is very high that you wouldn't and all you have to do is think it through you know what and Frank it's like you're really gonna put your family at risk to hide a group of another family in your attic for like multiple years while there's Nazis parading the street and where if you get exposed you all die you're gonna do that are you it's like very unlikely and and and no wonder it's not surprising that it's unlikely but you don't want to be inflating yourself with self you know with with fictional heroism without actually knowing the facts on the ground so I told her to read read it and to understand that the policemen were her and that's the thing to understand well  the idea that the Savior is the person who takes the world sins upon himself is exactly that it's exactly the same idea it's like the way that there stops being Nazis is for you to know that the Nazis were you and for you to decide not to do that again but you have to know we see this is the thing that people won't do you have to understand that you could not only do what the Nazi camp guards did an or Swiss but that you could all actually enjoy it and then you have to decide that you're not going to do that anymore and that's not an easy thing to figure out well then that's what that chapters about so that's a rough chapter man that's a rough chapter and that's only a bit of what it's about you know there's a lot of there's a lot in there and and that's  anyways that's what that's about um chapter Tim oh yes chapter nine is assume that the person you are listening to might know something you don't this is a chapter about conversation and about the different forms conversation takes and so chapter about humility and it's a chapter about listening and humility element is it took me a long time to understand why there's religious injunctions supporting humility to even understand what the word really meant and that sort of technical sense and it means something like this it means what you don't know is more important than what you know and that's a lovely thing too then then what you don't know can start to be your friend you see people are very defensive about what they know and for the reasons we've already discussed but the thing is you don't know enough and the Riu can tell you don't know enough because your life is not what it could be and neither is the life of the people around you you just don't know enough and so what that means is that every time you encounter some evidence that you're ignorant someone points it out you should be happy about that because you think oh you just told me how I'm wrong it's like great like maybe I had to sift through a lot of nonsense to get through the real message that you're telling me but if you could actually tell me some way that I'm wrong and then maybe give me a hint about how to not be wrong like that well then I wouldn't have to be wrong like that anymore that that would be a good thing and and you can you can you can embark on that adventure by listening to people and if you listen to people they will tell you they'll tell you amazing things if you listen to them and many of those things are little tools that you can put in your toolkit like Batman and then you can go out into the world and use those tools and you don't have to fall blindly into a pit quite as often and so the humility element is well do you want to be right or do you want to be learning and it's deeper than that it's do you want to be the the tyrannical king who's already got everything figured out or do you want to be the continually transforming hero or fool for that matter who's getting better all the time and that's actually a choice you know it's a deep choice and it's better to be the self transforming fool who's humble enough to make friends with what he or she doesn't know and to listen when people talk and listening is a transformative exercise like if if you listen to the people in your life for example if you actually listen to them they'll tell you what's wrong with them and how to fix it and what they want they can't even help it if you start listening because people are so shocked if you actually listen to them that they tell you all sorts of things that they might not have even intended to things they don't even know and then you can you can work with that and so and the other thing that's so interesting you know now and then you have a meaningful conversation right you have a good conversation with someone you walk when you think geez you know we really connected and I know more than I did when I came away from that conversation and during the conversation you're really engrossed in it and that that that feeling of being engrossed is a feeling of meaning and the feeling of meaning is engendered because you're having a transformative conversation so your brain produces that feeling of meaning for it says oh yeah it's exactly where you should be right here now it's it's the right place and time for you and that's a great place to occupy and so a good conversation where people are listening has exactly that nature and the reason it has that nature is because it is in fact transformative it's one of the truisms of clinical psychology like if you're a clinical psychologist a huge part of what you do is just listen to people it's like you know old they come in they're unhappy and they'd rather not be something like that you say well why do you think you might be unhappy and they don't know they have some ideas they may have to ramble around for like a year before they figure out why they're unhappy they get rid of a bunch of reasons why they thought they were unhappy that are untrue and then you kind of get to the heart of the problem then you might ask them well if you could have what you wanted so that your life would be okay what would that look like then they have to ramble around a bunch about that because they don't really know but the listening will straighten them out because people think by talking and in order to think you have to have someone to listen because it's very hard to think hardly anyone can think and even the people who can think can only think about a limited number of things but almost everybody can talk and you can listen to yourself talk and if someone listens to you then well then you also have a foil for your thoughts right because you can watch the person when you're talking and see if you're boring or see if you're amusing or if you're engrossing all of those things and so listening that's a very good thing I owed lino Carl Rogers dictum he was a famous clinical psychologist this is another great little tip Rodgers said here's a trick to tell if you listening so let's say someone lays out their perspective for you and then what you do is say look here's what I think you said I think you said this and this and this and this and then this is that right have I got what you're saying right and maybe the person says God you haven't been listening at all and you know then they have to straighten you out or maybe they say yeah yeah you've got it and then the nice thing about that is that you summarized their argument for them which can be very helpful and for you but also you don't get to make the person into a straw man so like if you're arguing with your wife let's say or your husband big parties gonna want to win that's stupid because if you win you get to be top Lobster but they get to be bottom Lobster and if you want to live with bottom Lobster then like more power to you but I wouldn't recommend it right because you don't want that you want to you want to defeat your wife in an argument oh well great like if she was gonna disappear tomorrow no problem but like you're gonna like live with defeated miserable her for the next week that's no good so you listen and you think okay well here's here's what you what I think you said and maybe even make it a little stronger and more elaborated than was the case with the original utterance so that you get the damn argument right because you don't want to win you want to fix the problem that's the winning and so the summary with listening is so useful for that because the person can say well yeah that's what I meant it's like then well then you have to grapple without and Roger said well people we usually won't because you know if you live with someone and they tell you the truth about the situation it usually means that there's something really stupid that you're doing you want them to but there's something stupid that you're doing that you know you're doing that you actually have to stop and you know that's difficult and unlikely but well if you don't stop then you get to have the same damn problem every day or every week for the rest of your life so it's probably better to under grow the misery of stopping it than the misery of continuing it but that's the injunction to listen rule 11 is don't bother children when they're skateboarding and that's a meditation on the difference between weakness and goodness you see one of the things that's happened in our society and especially with regards to our attitude towards men but also our attitude towards the masculinity and women so it's just as toxic for women is that we seem to have concluded that strong men are dangerous and that's partly because we think Western culture is a tyrannical patriarchy and the only reason you get to the top is because you misuse power and so all the men who are at the top of the Harkey are all misusing their power and they're all tyrannical and all the guys who have the aim and ambition to achieve that or just tyrants in training and that's sort of the basic attitude that we have towards our own culture and towards young men now and that's just there's everything about that is pathological and inexcusable and shameful I mean first the claim that Western culture [Applause] the idea that Western culture is primarily a patriarchal tyranny is like  well first of all it's it's historically ignorant beyond belief because what are you compared to what exactly how many civilized countries are there in the world you know three dozen the rest of them are run by brutal thugs right and it isn't just thugs at the talkman because that isn't how it works in Indian country that's corrupt the corruption is spread through the entire country so and we're not like that and that's that I mean Western culture is fundamentally honest and I can give an example of that because people don't like that idea eBay proved that because here here it did it did it was a very interesting thing because when a they first popped up like the cynic would say eBay is not gonna work because I don't know you you live in the other side of the country you're gonna send me junk and I'm gonna send you a check that bounces and that'll be the end of eBay right right that's what a cynic would say and then what happened was that brokers popped up and they said well look we'll guarantee the exchange rights for a fee 10% we'll make sure that you don't send junk and we'll make sure your cheque doesn't bounce and what happened was the brokers couldn't find enough business and the reason for that was all the transactions were honest all of them you know it's like 19 if you were on eBay and you have a reputation of less than 99 percent there's actually something wrong with you you know okay 98 percent but really it's that it's that tight and so the default position was you're offering this I'll buy it we'll make the exchange fairly and what happened was a bunch of capital that was frozen technically speaking junk that people had that other people could mean got freed up and he'd they freed up a tremendous amount of money for people and it was all a consequence of default honesty we also know that one of the best predictors of success in Western world is conscientiousness and conscientious people are honest and have integrity and are dutiful and do what they say they'll do and that's a really good predictor of long-term life success especially as a manager and administrator or something like that so  also chapter 11 is a discussion about the assault on the on the positive masculine and I read it partly as a continuation of what Nietzsche announced back in the late 1800s as the death of God right because in Western culture God was a masculine figure and the idea that the divine masculine had been decimated which was basically Nietzsche's pronouncement has filtered all the way down to masculinity itself and I think that's an absolutely appalling outcome it's it's it's something that could only be desired by someone who is a true enemy of humanity and so partly chapter 11 is a call to encouragement it's like you want and I've been telling young men in particular but young women as well though they don't seem to be quite as in need of the message to adopt responsibility for their life to tell the truth and to understand that their failure to participate fully in being leaves a hole that's precisely the size of their soul in the cultural landscape it's no joke we need all the light we can possibly bring to bear on the situation and when I firmly believe that and I believe that for all sorts of reasons and I think there are very deep reasons and that's partly why I would say rules to life also has it's a funny book because it has a very religious core but it's also very heavily grounded in evolutionary biology so but that's what chapter 11 is about and it's about people who are the enemy of the human spirit the people who restrict children's play for example which is a particularly pathological thing to do there's a movement now to not let children have best friends it's like really what the hell man that's so yeah there are so many things wrong with that idea that would take an entire another lecture just to scrape the surface but mostly it's just well I wouldn't even start on  final rule that's called pet a cat when you encounter one on the street and it's it's a very it's the most personal chapter in the book it's a lot about my daughter and my daughter was very ill when she was well when she was a kid but particularly when she was a teenager she had a very terrible time of it she had juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and when she was between the ages of 14 and 16 at first destroyed her hip which had to be replaced and then it destroyed the ankle on her other leg which had to be replaced and she walked around for two years on broken legs and she was taking massive doses of opiates and could hardly stay awake and like and she had this advanced autoimmune disease which produced all sorts of other symptoms that were just as bad as the joint degeneration but which are harder to describe and so it's just bloody brutal you know and as a test of your faith there's almost nothing that's more direct than a serious illness inflicted upon an innocent child right and so the chapter is a meditation on that and also on well what to do in a situation like that because everyone is going to have a situation like that in some sense you know because you'll be faced with illness in the people that you love and in crisis and so it's a disc it's a practical guide to coping with those sorts of things like in one of the things you do when you're overwhelmed by crisis is you shorten your time frame you know it's like you can't think about next month maybe you can't even bloody well think about next week or maybe not even tomorrow you know because now is just so overwhelming that that's all there is it's like and that's what you do you cut your timeframe back until you can cope with it and if it's not the next week that you see how to get through then it's the next day and if it's not the next day then it's the next hour and if it's not the next hour then it's the next minute and you know people are very very very very tough and it turns out that if you face things it turns out that if you face things that you can put up with a lot more than you think you can put up with and you can do it without becoming corrupted and she did recover quite quite fully and much as a consequence of her own nationÃ\xads because she figured out what was wrong with her and then took the necessary steps to fix it which is nothing short of a bloody miracle as far as I'm concerned and anyway as part of the the the cat bit is I actually start by talking about our dog who actually died about a year ago but he's still alive in the book I you know I let people know because dog lovers love dogs and if you love cats then they think you don't like dogs and they don't like you so I also point out at the beginning of the chapter that you know if you want to pet a dog on the street that's okay too so you don't have to get up in arms about it but but the idea is that you know you have to be alert when you're suffering you have to be alert to the beauty in life the unexpected beauty in life and that's kind of what I was trying to get across with the idea of the cat there's this cat that lives across the street from us called ginger and ginger is a Siamese cat and cats really aren't domesticated they technically speaking they're still wild animals but they kind of like people god only knows why but they do you know and so ginger will come wandering over and our dog looks at her but they're friends and she rolls over on his back and seco used to you know knows are a bit and and then she kind of mosey over and let you pet her if she was feeling like it's out day and you know you have to look for those little bit of that little bit of sparkling crystal in the darkness when things are bad you have to look and see where things are still beautiful and where there's still something that's sustaining and you know you narrow your timeframe and you'd be grateful for what you have and that can get you through some very dark times and maybe even successfully if you're lucky but even if unsuccessfully then maybe it's only tragic and not absolute hell and you can do that you know in the worst situation you can make it only tragic and not hell and there's a big gap between tragedy and hell you know there's nothing worse at a deathbed than to see the people there fighting the death is bad enough but you can take that as terrible as it is and make it into something that's absolutely unbearable and maybe I think and this is sort of what I closed the book with is this idea is that if we didn't all attempt to make terrible things even worse than they are then maybe we could tolerate the terrible things that we have to put up with in order to exist and maybe we could make the world into a better place you know and it's what we should be doing and what we could be doing because we don't have anything better to do and that's what the book is about and that's the end of 12 rules for life  [Applause] [Music]  [Applause]  well we've overrun joyously and normally I would have sort of cut the talk and done some things so we can have questions that I really didn't think it was appropriate this evening stroke was absolutely - and inspiring but sir I'm gonna do one question one question only and and I'm gonna leave Jordan to actually decide what's the question he's going to ask so I'm going to take three from the audience I'm gonna read out three that event have come from the livestream one from the livestream is how do you challenge the identity politics of today the second is a more personal one is word you fall short yourself in these twelve rules and is it a constant adjustment and now let me take three questions from the audience and I'll leave Jordan to then decide which is the last question that he wants to ask so first hand there first of all it's an honor to be at your lecture and the question is I wanted to ask like for example some people like for example stefan molyneux who interviewed you puts I think tremendous attention to admitting Falls of parents and admitting the harm that was done when getting better and working through adversive childhood experience and I wanted to ask you about about that what you think about that my question is about chapter 9 about being humble and listening to what your enemies are saying and criticizing you I'm a kind of person who kind of speak speak my thoughts so I I speak them to my friends and see how they bounce at them as so I noticed that there's always a group of my friends who always criticize what I'm saying and not even try to understand what I'm coming I'm coming from and I've always wondered how to deal with that I mean I want to listen to what they're saying but they are not understanding what I'm they're not trying to listen to what I'm saying so what would you do in that situation very briefly okay there's a line in the New Testament that's relevant to that do not cast pearls before swine and what that means is that if people are not listening to you stop talking to them and that's really that is the best piece of advice that I can give you and what happens is is that if you stop talking to people who aren't listening to you and start watching them instead they will tell you what they're up to but so if you have things to say say them but you find people that will listen talk to them the ones who aren't listening pull back because you're you're devaluing what you have to say by offering it to an audience that does nothing but rejected and that's a good guideline to life in general so pull back yep and our last question is gentleman over there with the in blue thank you it brought smile to my face when you mentioned the work of John Taylor Gatto and I just wanted to know what you think the relationship is between the classic Trivium and the Holy Trinity and if there is how has that changed over time I'm going to leave you to answer one question only okay okay and then  and then you're gonna be back on stage dedicating yes yes okay okay I think I'm going to answer where do you fall short in these twelve rules is it a cause constant adjustment you know like I wrote these rules why did I write these rules well you know and especially when I said well you should try to improve yourself instead of trying to set the world straight or instead of worrying about what other people are doing wrong you might say well that's a hell of a thing for someone to say you just wrote a book called twelve rules for life it's like you know but the thing is is that I wasn't just writing that I was writing that for me as much as for anyone else and I mean that's I really mean that sincerely you know I had an opportunity to spend somewhere around five years meditating on how you should conduct yourself so that your life is what it could be and like I'm in the group of people that I'm advising you know you know what I mean it's like all of these things are very difficult to stand up straight to remember that and to treat yourself like you're someone worthwhile and to make friends with people who are good for you and and and to tell the truth or at least not to lie I mean these are all ideals right and especially taken as a whole they constitute a kind of ideal and you never approve you never you never attain the ideal the I and not only that it recedes as you approach it right because you straighten yourself out you think well I've got it now and you think now wait a minute there's more to go there's still more to go and then you get that much farther along the line you think oh yeah I thought this was the end of the road it's like no there's plenty of imperfections left to iron out and so it is a constant adjustment and but there's something about that that's also positive because you might say that it's not so much that there isn't such a thing as a good person it's that our idea of what constitutes good isn't right because a good person is someone who's trying to get better and no matter how good you are there's better that you can get but the real goodness is in the attempt right it's in the it's in the process to use somewhat of a cliche you know there's this and I'll close with this and it's a good way to close you know and this is a psychological observation the the central figure of Western culture is Christ and we can look at that psychologically because Christ is the dying and resurrecting hero and what does that mean psychologically well it means that you learn things painfully and when you learn something painfully a part of you has to die that's the pain you know when a dream is shattered for example a huge part of you that constituted that dream maybe even the biological substrate of that gene has to be stripped away and burned and so life is a constant process of death and rebirth and to participate in that fully is to allow yourself to be redeemed by it and so the good is that process of death and rebirth voluntarily undertaken it's like you're not as good as you could be so you let that part of you die and if someone comes along and says you know there's some dead wood here man it needs to be burned off you think well that's stuff still a bit alive when that burns it's gonna hurt it's like yeah well no kidding but maybe the thing that emerges in its place is something better and I think this is the secret of human beings this is what we're like you know unlike any other creature is that we can let our old selves die and let our new selves be born and that's what we should do and so where do I fall short in these twelve rules well endlessly because well here's a way of thinking about it until the entire world is redeemed we all fall short and that's probably a good place to stop  [Music] you",1
502,so i asked them about their plans to kill people and they said yes there are too many people on the planet we need to get rid of of several billion and war doesn't seem to work so we're going to use disease and starvation he knew what was happening and he attempted to warn us when he left office he told us quite bluntly in no uncertain terms to be aware of the military-industrial complex and who is the military-industrial complex it is the members of the council on foreign relations and since the inception of the trilateral commission the trilateral commission as well i don't know if i'm a official member i've i've spoken there uh it basically is just a forum where much people talk about foreign policy was made up of the executive committee of the council on foreign relations now it is extremely significant that you understand that the first six members from the government along with president eisenhower were also members and long time members of the council on foreign relations they believed in that organization they believed in its goals which was one world government number 15 great industrial depression and financial panic unemployment hunger shortage of food use this to control the masses or the mobs and use them up to wipe out all those who dare to stand in the way well i'll tell you right now every expert i've talked to is talking about food shortage and it's coming i'm convinced what were they because they uh i'd never seen anything like that and uh and his statement was that if he told me i would be one of few people we are now recording again now if you think this is crazy and if you think there's no way that they could imprison you because you know what it says here we've got to be uh we got to be uh invaded an invasion of the territory of the united states earth's possessions declaration war by congress or insurrection within the united states and aid of a foreign enemy how many of you sheeple have ever read the omnibus counter-terrorism bill submitted to congress by william jefferson clinton and eventually passed and enacted into law by the congress of the united states of america which gives the president the president the sole means of determining who is and is not an enemy of the united states is a terrorist is operating in conjunction with any foreign power and it gives him ladies and gentlemen the power to name any group any organization or any person or persons to have them arrested without benefit of habeas corpus without trial without trial and to be deported out of the united states if that's what they want to do with you or to just lock you up in some dungeon somewhere where you will be forgotten forever you didn't know that well i suggest that you get oklahoma city day one because the entire text of the counterterrorism bill is printed in the appendix of that book 640 pages of the documented and sourced truth of what really happened in oklahoma city on april the 19th 1995 now well i'm not going to read it because the law is too hard to understand only if you're a complete brainless idiot who never studied english in your life and can't use a dictionary and my little eight-year-old daughter can do all of those things so how about that how about that quote the law goes on to outline a course of action for the arrested individual that in general is at odds with normal judicial procedure oh really is that a surprise he first would be given a hearing without right or bail before a preliminary hearing officer whose decision could then be appealed to a detention review board at no time though the attorney general required to furnish information the revelation of which would disclose the identity are evidence of government agents or officers which he believes it would be dangerous to national safety and security to divulge shades of adolf hitler my goodness in other words the government can decline to present any evidence whatsoever in effect transforming the traditional presumption of innocence into a presumption of guilt the burden of disproof is on the prisoner these same ground rules apply to any later review of the case by the united states court of appeals the mccarran act was passed overwhelmingly by frightened liberals and conservatives alike in both the house and senate vetoed by president truman then passed again over his veto though it was approved with the rest of the act the title ii amendment was blasted by senator pat mccarran himself as a concentration camp measure pure and simple senator carl month tagged it a program for establishing concentration camps into which people might be put without benefit of trial but merely by executive fiat simply by an assumptive mind you that an individual might be thinking about engaging in espionage or sabotage might be thinking an assumption that an individual might be thinking might be thinking might be thinking about engaging in espionage and sabotage you see ladies and gentlemen this is what i've been telling you for years quick this republican democrat all of this other baloney joke you're either for freedom or you're not if you're for big brother government and more laws and more welfare and more of this and more regulation and more licenses you are not an american if you are for freedom if you are for the disclosure of all of these secret things like this if you are poor the protection of the rights of the individual if you are for the constitution for the united states of america welcome aboard if you're not you're an enemy of the republic i don't care what you call yourself i don't care who you are and i don't care how mad this makes you i just simply don't care it just blows everybody's mind on the internet when they attack me somewhere and i send them a message back saying i just don't care what you think period who can read i understand what freedom is i understand what despotism is i understand what tyranny is and if you promote any of those things i don't care what you think i am your enemy simple as that simple as that what you think doesn't even even register a little bit on a scale of respect here i've been all over the world as a boy and as a man i've fought a war i've seen what despotism is i've seen what tyranny is i've seen what freedom is what it can be and how it's being taken away and i see how most of the american people are fooled into thinking that tyranny is freedom it's not it's not said the old north dakota dissenters senator sinator senator william langer and i quote so it is now proposed to have concentration camps in america we can be absolutely certain that the concentration camps are for only one purpose namely to put in them the kind of people those in authority do not like end quote actually there was there was a very grisly precedent for this type of mass imprisonment during world war ii the government arrested confiscated the property of and granted no hearings to our redress for the 109 650 japanese americans who were held in 10 relocation centers the united states supreme court more over unanimously upheld this action in 1943 and its decision was cited by congress in 1950 to justify america's first peacetime concentration camp measure it is now and was then and always will be unconstitutional the federal government cannot do anything more than what is granted to it by the constitution for the united states of america and that does not include concentration camps in fact in a state of emergency the only power given to the federal government by the constitution of the united states of america is the temporary suspension of habeas corpus for the duration of the emergency only period they don't have the power to suspend the constitution they don't have the power to take away any rights of the people the only power they have is to suspend temporarily during the course of the emergency only the power of the writ of habeas corpus title ii section 104 small c of the mccarran act provides that persons detained shall be confined in such places of detention as may be prescribed by the attorney general in 1952 accordingly the justice department designated six sites for the detention camp program listen very carefully go check it out camps were set up on a standby basis at allen wood pennsylvania avon park florida el reno oklahoma florence and wittenberg arizona and tule lake california so the united states does indeed so the united states does indeed so the united states does indeed have a concentration camp law as well as camp facilities to match yet both were byproducts of joe mccarthy era frenzy and neither lawn or camps have ever been put to use for emergency detention purposes but they can be the law has since been expanded ladies and gentlemen and money has been allotted by the congress to build them all over the place and they are being built and have been built and some will continue to be built don't believe me look it up look it up ladies and gentlemen what do you think about that did they get your blood boiling well it should you should be hot about this uh here's something that you uh need to understand folks our military is being reorganized and their mission is being redefined the new definition is to function toward the goals of the new world order now why isn't our military why are not our military active and retired professionals officer core enlisted men non-commissioned officers petty officers why aren't they speaking out against this radical conversion of the very purpose of having a military force could it be that they're for this i don't know the answer to that i do know that one world one world government as an answer to war is taught in all the military academies and in the naval war college and the army war college and i know that many many high-ranking officers have made statements on television and in writings and we have a huge a huge report from the naval war college outlining the future role of the united states navy in the new world order and on the front page of this report which is several inches thick is the seal of the united states navy and the seal of fema so if you're still wondering if i'm nuts when i tell you this stuff i'm not we're looking for a an inexpensive method to get this printed up so that we can offer it to all of you out there so that you can read it and some of the other things if we can find a printer that's low enough we think we may have found one in albuquerque then we will begin printing it up and making it available as inexpensive as we possibly can let me just check and see if this is carolyn or if it's uh if it's the little children again hello you're on the air hello it's not carolyn okay now remember i just read the letter from the man in prison who used to publish a newsletter called grace and he sent me a copy of his friend's newsletter called the dove and i want to read you an excerpt from this newsletter because i think it's pertinent i've been warning you about trojan horses and i've been admonishing you to weed out the freemasons who are leading the patriots movements because they are trojan horses ,1
153,all right what's up y'all it's me it's kanye and it's michael um okay we're gonna go trim that all right y'all i'm back here with me it's me and michael we're gonna be doing what's easy and prevail here we're gonna be doing a podcast on we're gonna be doing some conspiracy theories all right first thing we're gonna start off with is i'm going straight to it fake movement okay so there's a theory that there's a fake moon and they never land on the moon they just did it in some type of studio or whatever like it wasn't real at all like let me show you let me show you that landing on the moon you see how this flag is waving yeah okay now if you're a space there ain't no air so how's the flag even waving in the first place you feel me see that was a red flag and there was a boot okay there's another boot mark and there's grass in the ground or whatever and it was a different footprint from the one that the suits they was wearing and just everything seemed very staged you feel me but how do you feel about that though oh she was [Laughter] i think it's fake because like if they're going into space and you go to space and you die how the hell do you know what to bring to space if the person that went to space didn't survive oh yeah okay there was another thing that i thought about too okay maybe because humans are so smart or whatever i mean you look like humans but um how if you have a whole jet or ship or whatever you going to a different moon or going to a different planet or whatever how the [ __ ] are you supposed to land like and everything in the pictures they showed us it's like i understand the planet was way smaller i mean yeah but it's like you could see all around it from just one picture of it it just doesn't seem right i don't know because they drop off half the damn they rock it anyways when they go up there yeah i don't know that's could be captain you feel me all right let's move on to the next like four times i'm saying and then it was like so many so many things that was wrong with in the first place didn't even make sense okay okay you know the ancient periods of whatever that we was taught about in school yeah i know what the tier means okay so those each one of those brick pyramids weighed 2.5 tons okay how the [ __ ] is humans picking up 2.5 hold on look at this there's two point three million stones on that pyramid there's no way no humans could have did that now what if some aliens from a different planet or whatever came down and built them pyramids all right it's that you know that bug no no no no no no think about it the universe is emptiness always expanding or whatever i want to say no aliens with no good technology just came to this [ __ ] and just made those nah i believe i believe that like when a person from like a phil or something or a god from back then that dutch the people were using slaves like no i think that people did make that like they were forced to though they didn't do it willingly oh yeah because remember okay i also remember we learned mr barcena class that they was doing it was like there was like slaves of benefits [Laughter] look look at teen titans go okay this is just something i randomly saw in teen titans you know how they be programming [ __ ] they just be mixing the trouble eyes so if teen titans they was talking about they had some like aliens and they showed the pyramids and all that they just be mixing the truth for lies that's why the simpsons they always be predictive programming and they put that [ __ ] in teen titans when they had the pyramids okay i'm gonna go to it three minutes shut up okay i don't try to fight this [ __ ] though [Music] okay it's not playing like oh play some now bro you see this right [Music] oh this [ __ ] is an alien you know star you watched teen titans before yeah i watched it before okay the sheer alien they just showed her as an alien they even gave her more characteristics they show her coming down [ __ ] putting pyramids on think herself because the humans couldn't do that imagine 10 people getting around a car trying to pick it up and moving it moving it you can't do that [ __ ] it's not humanly possible to pick up 2.5 tons but the go to a picture of the pyramid you're like a picture of it i can't spell it all i spent the right the first time god damn it bro look at how tall that [ __ ] is if it was even if that was okay what the hell they was even going up here imagine them trying to go up there and place pyramids up there yeah they had to be people following that from that [ __ ] i mean you could say and they just forced them to do it anyway but let me look at one brick off the pyramid that's what i was trying to see but it doesn't look like it breaks it looks like a whole bunch of those rocks put together yeah what a couple people definitely can definitely do that 2.5 them things look a little as hell too like if they tried to move that [ __ ] i don't know it looks like maybe five people if i okay maybe eight people can hurt her around that and then back then i'm pretty sure there was no strong ass [ __ ] like you know like me they could actually put in work like that so imagine eight people being hey now i'm that goat though you feel me but i can't imagine there being eight people being able to pick that up in that volume or whatever picking up 2.5 tons i can't even see nobody even i can i can't even see some of them people their ass used to be skinny as hell because their ass wasn't even eaten right i can't imagine that oh no i can't imagine i can't imagine some damn aliens coming down this whole look i can't imagine they asked damn lifted 200 pounds if they can't deal with 200 pounds separately i can't see how they lifted 2.5 tons together there's no way one way one brick wave two points yeah one brick didn't weigh that a brick probably weighed like maybe 200 maybe 500 something around there ain't no way but okay and it wasn't they didn't just have one people like look how many people look how many slaves they had during that time like not even slaves but like type [ __ ] you know what i mean all right okay two points okay there's they why would they be like okay we already know bro two point you can't see that playing 2.5 tons okay look limestone that oh what if they were just oh no bro i just i don't know i can't see i can't see someone like an alien [ __ ] coming down this damn why would they want to come here what the hell i don't know [Music] hey different different possibilities you never know i guess hey [ __ ] what i think what if they're here what if we air area 51. going to area 51 is actually you leaving this [ __ ] i'm gonna do a backflip into that oh me that's probably why they try to kill people that go next to that [ __ ] hey hey hold on in all seriousness how do you get a job working for area 51 probably got to be with the government yeah but this is like stem in the family like what if all they family just [ __ ] die now you probably have to be with the you probably got to be a signed contract or some type of dedication to the government so you got to do what they say you can do that just to see well you probably have to like swear on oath and type [ __ ] you know all types of security measures oh no i put that [ __ ] on put that [ __ ] on you now i'm joking [Music] if you wanna die bro but 2.3 billion bricks okay let's let's look how long it took them hold on what was that noise [Laughter] [Music] 20 years do you think they lift him look up how many people were used to build the pyramid i 20 to 30 000 people i okay hello 100k okay 100k workers by the monitoring you actually figured more than 20 30 000. okay let me go on my phone and do some math we gonna eyeball it for you okay let's do 100k plus 30k divided by two let's say there's 65 000 people working there people let's see how the ass looked no look don't mean nothing i know they don't mean nothing but that was not gonna be skinny as hell lifting though putting in your work but they worked like they did that for a living like they worked i'm not explaining but they wasn't weak like they they couldn't have been weak i'm not saying like they was totally weak but if y'all asked a slave or whatever yo ass not getting fed that much that ass probably ain't feeding you good yo ass got no breaks y'all got no time to recuperate only think they were slaves i forgot the word an indentured servant i'm pretty sure he doesn't remember that i just remember him saying they were slaves with benefits and that's yours like that 65 000 people okay let's say i'm trying to see one stone boom you see how big them stones is my [ __ ] them [ __ ] look fancy [ __ ] okay okay some of them some sources said when i looked there down they said 50 tons or whatever we just don't say they weighed two tons as much as a [ __ ] car if you have to place 2.3 million of those and you have to go up accelerate up like you walking up with them bricks stacking them down i mean you know what i think what's up i think that all right you know how it's sand around like it was in the desert see like in that picture down there oh this car i forgot it was touch street touch screen all right no it's sand all around right i don't feel like those bricks were or the whatever whatever those are that they i don't think that's how big they were i think they were smaller and then from the sand clustering on top of the pyramids that made it look and made it like it made it look yeah and it made it heavier so nowadays when we test and see how heavy they were it's like tons because the sand piled up onto the rocks and made the rocks bigger you get what i'm saying yeah i i get what you put down but i feel like they were smaller and they stacked them up in a pyramid shape and then the sand just kept on piling on top so the pyramid got bigger and then like you know yeah i know okay but it's like okay how much you want to say they weigh okay if they were two okay if they weighed 200 it wouldn't took 20 years let's keep it above but there's like four of them like four of them look look at the pyramid down there one two three four five six like six pyramids no below yeah right there oh yeah you know how hot it had to be out there but it has to be out there slaving after picking up the pyramid bro i don't know all i know is if if it was some humans that did that oh there's some goats jesus two points someone would say at 50 but i'm not even sure i didn't read that always so i'm gonna say it was 50 because i don't even feel like going back to read that [ __ ] 2.5 bro 2 million 300 like talk 2.3 million stones [ __ ] bricks [ __ ] that's light work with my pinkies i'm awesome i mean if your ass ain't doing that next another video probably like a couple seconds after this one but all right y'all it's been one drop of like follow me on ig klg underscore easy you feel me if you're [ __ ] with me ,1
516,hello I'm making this video because I want to show you the glory of the power chords that I rely on to power my cellphone and my headphones that only half work one earbud doesn't even work I don't know why don't just cut it maybe I will and the back cover of the book what to do oh no it's really the emotional incest syndrome what to do when a parent's love rules your life everything everywhere happens for a reason everything there's a rhyme and a reason to everything and art is everywhere Paul McCartney has passed from the earth and now lives in the spirit world the band The Beatles was a tool that the Tavistock Institute used to engineer society the nice young men from Manchester England who took the world by storm was presented in contrast to the not-so-nice young men the Rolling Stones and given the choice many gravitated towards the Beatles not knowing that as the Beatles fell into drugs and helped to form the counterculture and you know free love that in choosing this band that would fall from grace they slowly lost their hold on the truths of existence the truth that there is a God the truth that a human being a man or a woman can stand in their own power and attract good into their lives that you can commit a loving act and you are rewarded that all you really have to do in life is trust your Creator and do good be perfect as your heavenly parent is perfect Paul McCartney was replaced with a freemason who was groomed for the job you can see the difference in the facial structure a lot of latex was used some plastic surgery and they created a new Paul McCartney Paul McCartney was as far as people could tell beheaded in a traffic accident and then in the 1960s it was somewhere around there Paul McCartney pass to the spirit world the man who replaced him was placed in the leadership role of this band and although people speculated about it no one knew for sure and that's part of the trickery that's part of the usurpation you present information and you present a counter to that information that acts to confuse you and in your confusion you are manipulated so the freemasons are up to no good you know many people say that the people on the lower levels of Freemason aren't such bad people they don't know what they're doing um there's one problem with that and although I agree with that to a large degree the making of an oath to a group of people and even if it seems like a joke saying that I will never divulge of the secrets of this organization making an oath to anyone that should you break that oath harm will befall yourself or others is sinful in fact joining an organization that revels in secrecy is sinful why would you be attracted to such an organization why would you be wowed and moved by ridiculous some symbology if you want symbols look to the world around you look to the symbols inherent in your physical form look to the form of nature the form of animals trees birds look to the physical laws that God has created and what they represent these people in Freemasonry have it as their core belief that we exist in duality we do not exist in duality that is ridiculous it is a ridiculous notion to suggest that we exist in duality the only do allottee that exists is one that we've created for ourselves the only do ality that exists is exists in false creation which is not of God you look at your body look at your physical form it works you look at how you take an action to move forward in a direction and you attract good things unto yourself you attract success look at the birds and the mammals and the reptiles and the sky and the atmosphere and the water in the air water vapor and rain and lighting storms and the food chain and the plentiful abundance that is all around there is nothing dual about that a lot of people will say well you have men and women they're opposites how are they opposites how is a woman opposite to a man God created human beings and and gave them the gift of love and a way to express their law physically that way is the sex act the sex act is a beautiful act it's a beautiful expression of love there's nothing dual about it there's nothing a posts opposing about it there's nothing opposite about it it's not opposite it works together as it happens God also made homosexual souls who still can enjoy lovemaking they do it in a different way woman to woman man to man but it's still of God and when you achieve higher levels you will see that their love is just as real as the bond in the heterosexual soul and if you don't believe me that's fine but at some point you will see the truth but there's nothing opposite in this universe that God created God is a loving being God is our parent God loves us and desires our enrichment and knows that the best way that we can be enriched is by our own freewill choice God made it that way the only opposition we find is our own resistance to the truth our own desire not to act the forces that may be in any form in any capacity that you may deem holds you from greater joy greater fortune untold vistas of surprise and excitement and fascination all those forces have no power over you they have zero power over you you as a soul have agency the only power that anyone has over you is the power that you give them it's a simple idea there are people who have decided that it is best to form an organization that might provide themselves with some means of exerting a more permanent I'm looking for my word here a more permanent hold on the world and their means and methods are flawed because what is not loving is always a flawed course although they have some power it's only due to the power that human beings every man and woman in the world gives to them and they also have the power that spirits in the spirit world who have passed on whose interests remain on the earth to their own detriment I might add but they have the assistance of these dark spirits who have yet to come to the truth who have yet to desire the beautiful life-giving love of God who have yet to realize that God can be their only master they have decided to assist these wrongdoers and it is to your detriment to assume that there is no spirit world there is no life after death atheism is your only recourse it is to your detriment that you would accept such nonsense the spirit world is real spirit influence is real and it matters so that's really all I have to say in this video I hope you've enjoyed ,1
363,hello freak [ __ ] he has a good time debunking things but he has an official story mentality is what I would call it where no matter what like there's people that are objective and there's people that are deep bunkers and he's a deep bunker and it doesn't necessarily mean he's wrong about a lot of stuff but it does mean that he goes into things with the intention to debunk and the intention to almost always gravitate towards an official tourist yeah every single day he acted alone yeah that's a goof come on man that one's goofy he believes tower 7 collapsed at freefall speed because of fires there's a lot of people who believe that unfortunately I'm not a [ __ ] engineer I would like to know know whether or not it's possible to burn a building so bad inside that it does collapse like that it's impossible I don't know if that's true it's no it's it all you have to do is talk to engineers and architects I've talked to them you could you cried there's no there's no architects that outside of NIST a government agency there's no architects fighting for to debunk the tower 7 there's none and every true you I don't know if you know that there's like but are there's got to be some architects and engineers that don't think that that building fell because it was demolished look no well if you understand how it's there's about a hundred thousand architects and engineers and the associations like the American Association of Architects in here there's about a hundred thousand and Richard gage he's one of them and he didn't know anything about he thought it was a it wasn't an inside job it took him years and then he didn't really know about tower 7 most of them don't know about Tower 7 what he does now he discovered it and what he does now is just go from convention to convention sitting 15 architects down at a time and boom about 99% of them they all believe it though they didn't even know there was a third tower it was not in the media that much they basically I think that's crazy I think by this time everybody knows about tower cellar they still don't know most people think no they don't you they don't have a ladder on the mainstream media anybody people have talked about it enough online to the point more than ever but now more than ever yes they go to hear about that Tower 7 thing but they don't really know the details they just kind of just know about it you know did you ever see the video that shows the full collapse which takes a lot longer you see the first collapse it was the top of the thing falls into the center and that's the elevations yeah they explain architects and engineers I've sat with them I'm no structural engineer but you tell the comedy this is what if someone told you if someone told you there's 85 columns that hold up Tower 7 mm-hmm and if someone told you of a structural engineer told you would you think he was crazy or would you believe him if he said and it makes sense I mean it's common sense the only way you're gonna get a building to come down like that any building any structure is you have to blow up all 80 comps at the same time otherwise it won't go down like that to me that's common sense to someone who believes this the government agency said no that's not true one column went and then it spiraled out of control because of fires when you talk to structural engineers I've had Richard gage on my podcast twice every time it comes back he gets more he just piles on more because all I gotta do is sit him down they don't know nobody knows that's the truth see as he ever it debated someone who's like an opposing viewpoint look into it it's common sense anybody knows you so you think that they know that it's not true they think they think that power tower 7 was an inside job they don't want to debate it because they can't win do you really think they think that I say that again so you think the people that are debunking it so like if he's got this opinion there's no our architects and engineers debunking it that's already looked into that that's already been lately that's already been young inside that's gotta be a Texan engineers just disagree mm-hmm come on man you don't think there's any people do find a video of a real Jamie see if you can but doesn't that make sense an engineer told you a struck a dude who build skyscrapers told you to your face like I and told to my face they said the only way that thing and you see it on video engineer after engineer after engineer are they all crazy the engineer engineer after engine it's impossible when you look into it it's impossible for a building to collapse like that unless all 80 columns are blown up at the same time we've covered this but here's the I don't know anything about engineering I don't know if you have diesel fires that get out of control if it weakens the entire structure where it just collapses like that you have you have guests all the time there are experts in fields that you're not experts in but when you sit here find out sometimes they're wrong about some stuff and then they find out that they're making some of it up or this but an engineer a guy who builds understand this right doesn't it make sense does that make sense Google like try to figure out like who resists architects and engineers like what is it I'm reading right now an article from The Boston Globe that talks about truthers and 9/11 and Richard gages talked about I think they might have interviewed Inman and I'm trying to figure out what they're talking about there's got to be some engineers that have had a conversation or debate okay maybe they're out there I don't know [ __ ] I don't know how my [ __ ] computer works I don't know do you know anything that constructs anything you know a lot of [ __ ] you know but if somebody wanted to argue with me about the components and how they worked on a laptop I would have to let go I you're probably right I have to talk to some computer engineer who's gonna tell me the actual reality of it I've talked about it want build buildings I've had a mom I'm sure but I just can't believe all the people that build buildings think it's an inside job so okay what percent okay what if nine would be pretty impressive if 90 percent that we pretty impressive it was a 50 that would be impressive exactly it's 50 percent would be impressed it's about in the 90s I don't know if that's right so I don't know where you get in that number I'm getting it from Richard gage who's the head of architects and engineers 9/11 truth right they add another couple I understand but you know but he might be a little biased right I mean if he's the head of architects and engineers from 9/11 truth and he tells you that 90 percent of the architects and engineers out there think it's an inside job it might be a little biased I don't know if that's true and I don't think you do necessarily either I think we're just guessing I believe it to see I would love to see an architect or an engineer that disagreed with him talk to him about it and go over the data because until that happens I don't know what the [ __ ] they're talking about no nobody argues with them nobody does that's gotta be there's got to be someone who debunks that guy everybody debunks everybody no they definitely a smear campaign are you kidding smear campaign or is it just that they're saying things that he's saying that aren't correct it's not just him he's just saying he's one of many it's common sense dude maybe okay it's just right but I don't know I don't know anything about making buildings I don't know anything about what it takes for a building to collapse I don't know totally I don't know anything maybe it got hot but it's not just hot it's shanks of guns that were in the basement I want to believe that I want to believe that fires made it hot I don't want to believe they blew it up because that's [ __ ] that's scary I want I want to believe the fire if a fire is in a basement and the fire has diesel fuel and it's burning at some insane temperature and this [ __ ] [ __ ] loads of diesel fuel down there I wonder what effect that has I don't know do you I'm pretty sure based on my life's experience that that's not gonna bring down a building fuel life it's based on common sense it's common sense that yeah if a building the building's gonna fall at free spot fall speed boom like that if a engineer after engineer after engineer at some point I'm gonna believe them at some point I'm not gonna understand any but I don't I don't know if you've necessarily looked into the engineers at disagree I know I know there's a smear campaign there okay but have you looked into the engineers there's none there's nothing there's no there's no documentary it's kinda there's no documentary find a documentary a documentary for it to make sense what was that what if it's an article what if it's a peer review paper what if it's some sort of those are all dude that's a smear camp there's that side there's the elites they don't want this out and then there's people trying to get the truth out so the elite have the control of the media so how are you gonna they have paid shills on you don't think you think did they drop they would have dropped the ball big time like Ernest Byner 1987 for the brows they would have dropped the ball if you're not if you don't have paid shills online strategically pushing the agenda come on there's a bunch of fake [ __ ] on richard gage thing that i was trying to debunk see if anybody's debunking him I'm looking around I'm just looking around the Boston Globe article says that there's a small vocal subset of people of Engineers that are with this Richard gage that's what I read I never read that it was like some overwhelming number just keep keep stirring it's it's hard because it's fun it's exciting it's exciting to think that there's some sort of a gigantic ball of super geniuses that run the world and they decided to blow up Tower seven you know what's funny about the moon [ __ ] is the hardest [ __ ] ever accomplished the greatest by the human race the greatest accomplishment ever was landing on the moon right right so you would think holy [ __ ] I don't think it does know what listen okay okay but let's just at the time at the time know Internet is the biggest okay okay but I'm just talking about like a physical achievement three dudes they got shot up in a rocket they were in a like a orbiter and then the orbiter shot out the lunar like the LEM and then it lands they played golf went doom bug riding the donuts in the sand they get take pictures they get back in take-off dock with that orbiter and then fly back that's the hardest [ __ ] ever no one died yeah can you imagine can you imagine that second mission six months later they did it again when when they had to break the news that they were gonna use different astronauts because every mission they use different astronauts what didn't you think they would like a show like I have the same star over no no the three dudes have pulled it off keep doing it they do know you're kidding they did it before yeah but they don't wanna keep doing it what if they were planning on using Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong but they just [ __ ] got egos and [ __ ] they start going to clubs to the moon for like you know seventy thousand dollars they've got that government check she won the second album or on the second it just like the record business you know what I mean we make that much babe of course I say listen we'll get you on that second on the second and third land you gonna be famous you're gonna be [ __ ] doing all sorts of press think about the [ __ ] think about the coke they probably got blowed out and got too cocky and wanted to renegotiate oh my god and then NASA said we just got to go with some new dudes they made $8 per diem when Uncle Sam [ __ ] you raw dog he uses sand Uncle Sam used this broken class on his dick that dude was hovering in an orbiter he was hovering in an orbiter and they landed some little piece-of-shit lunar lander would delay and then they took and they show the only time ever they got one shot of it taking off and whatever was filming it followed it all the way up yeah like who was no no there was a live remote control that's it they said that they could control from far from Houston and for sure that works the moon landings are so got down ridiculous Oh [ __ ] there's video of them like just maybe a hundred thousand feet in the air and they're like filming it making it look you know they're manipulating what the [ __ ] come on that video stream that's the damming I've never seen anybody [Applause] [Music] [Applause] ,1
319,"We've all found ourselves in conversation and felt attacked like we started off talking about one thing and then the other person twisted our words and before we knew it, we lost our cool, lost respect in their eyes, and maybe even acted like a jerk. Now, I don't normally do the same person twice in a row but this interview between Cathy Newman and Jordan Peterson was just too interesting of an opportunity to discuss how you can handle someone who uses subtle conversational tricks to bully you into looking dumb. So in this video, you're gonna see firsthand some of the most common tricks that people might be using on you and you're also gonna learn how to reverse those so that you can walk out of a kind of aggressive situation having earned more respect than you had going in. So first off, to stop a conversational bully, you have to realize what's going on before it's too late. Now, typically, a person will reveal their aggressive attitude early on with their tone of voice and their word choice â€” kind of like this â€” ...but I wasn't specifically aiming this message at young men to begin with; it just kind of turned out that way butâ€” And it's mostly, you admit, it's mostly men listening. In this case, Cathy is indicating very clearly that she thinks Jordan has done something wrong. Otherwise, why would she use the word ""admit?"" She makes her stance clear a moment later when she implies that he should be bothered for being divisive. Just watch. Does it bother you that your audience is predominantly male? Is that a bit divisive? The point here is that even when they're being passive-aggressive, people will often indicate that they're about to attack you before they actually do. So if you hear someone say something like, ""Well, what do you have to say for yourself?"" be prepared. That person thinks that you've done something wrong and you need to be very careful what you say next not because you did do something wrong but because a conversational bully may be trying to trap you into saying something that you disagree with so that they can attack that straw man. And the first way that this often happens is called the ""so-you\'re-saying trap."" Here\'s what it looks like. So you're saying women have some sort of duty to sort of help fix the crisis of masculinity? Women want to dominate â€” is that what you're saying? So you're saying that anyone who believes in equality whether you call them feminists or whatever you want to call them should basically give up because ""it ain\'t gonna happen."" Let me just get this straight; you're saying that we should organize our societies along the lines of the lobsters. The general pattern here is that someone says, ""So you\'re saying..."" and then proceeds to oversimplify or mischaracterize what you actually said. I won't spend too long here because it's very easy to spot and it's rather simple to avoid and get around by saying, ""Well, actually, what I was saying is..."" and then repeat yourself. ...along the lines of the lobsters. I'm saying that it's inevitable that there will be continuity in the way that animals and human beings organize their structures. But there's a much sneakier way that people may mischaracterize your beliefs and then attack them. Basically, it's when someone's words imply that you believe something you don't and they don't actually say it. So in business, they call this ""assuming the sale"" like when a car salesman says, ""So would you like that with the leather interior or with the fabric interior?"" before you even decided to buy the car. Now, with the several thousand dollar purchase, you're likely to notice this and say, ""Whoa, whoa, whoa. Who said I was buying in the first place?"" But it's very likely that this is happening to you in conversation all the time and you don't even notice. Here's how it might look. [Cathy talks over Jordan] Yeah, but why? Why should woman put up with those reasons? Embedding the question ""why should women put up with it?"" are several important presuppositions; namely â€” one, that there is something to put up with and two, that Jordan thinks woman should put up with it. Now, the trap here for Jordan would be to answer Cathy's question directly and many of us fall into it in similar situations then we start arguing for things that we don't even really believe just out of habit. Instead, you need to identify that hidden presupposition and then call it out. So watch how carefully Jordan listens to Cathy's questions so that he can catch what she's not saying. ""Why should women put up with it?"" I\'m not saying they should put up with it. I\'m saying that the claimâ€” Here's another example of assuming-the-sale from later in that conversation. See if you can spot the hidden presupposition and ask yourself what you might say to respond to it. ...which women do a lot of. But why shouldn't women have the right to choose not to have children? So what's the hidden presupposition â€” that Jordan thinks women must have children. And of course, he defends a woman's right to make any decision about that. ...the right to choose and demand it, correct? They do. They can. Yeah, that's fine. But you're saying that makes them unhappy. Here's one more example. See if you can spot the hidden presupposition here. [Cathy talks over Jordan] So you want to say to your followers now, ""Quit the abuse. Quit the anger."" Did you catch it? The presupposition is that Jordan's followers are abusing people. Now, he can't answer that question directly; he has to address that hidden point first and he does. Well, we'd need some substantial examples of the abuse and the anger before I could detail that question. There's a lot of it out there. When I cut the clips like this, it makes it very easy to see these hidden presuppositions but in real time, this can be difficult. One simple thing that you can do to make it easier on yourself is to purposely assume a relaxed posture as Jordan does throughout this entire conversation. Now, this posture actually helps you to think less frantically because your body is signalling to your brain that everything is okay; you're in control. You'll also want to give yourself some time to pause after each question which Jordan definitely does. In addition, you're going to want to study up on frames and frame games because there's a clearly a whole level of conversation that is going on behind the words. Now, I've talked about this in other videos specifically the one on Tyrion Lanister from Game of Thrones and I'll leave a link to that in the description if you want to check it out. Moving along though, the last clip contains a small example of the third conversational bully tactic in this video which I\'m naming the ""smash technique."" Take a look. [Cathy talks over Jordan] So you want to say to your followers now, ""Quit the abuse. Quit the anger."" It's subtle here but Cathy smashes together two very different terms â€” abuse and anger. Now, by ending on anger, it would be easier for Jordan to just forget it and answer the question. But that would tacitly accept that his followers were abusing people. That's why the smash technique is so frustrating; people are embedding hidden statements that you actually disagree with and then moving through them before you have the time to voice that disagreement. You may also have seen people barrage you with questions just to overwhelm you into having to accept their points like this â€” ...otherwise, why would that only be seven women running FTSE 100 companies in the UK? Why would there still be a pay gap... [Jordan talks over Cathy] Why are women at the BBC saying that they're getting paid illegally less than menâ€” It can be easy to get overwhelmed and to lose focus as you try to answer all of these questions but with the smash technique in general, the best policy is to slow down the tempo of conversation and tackle one question or one point at a time. Let's just go to the first question; those both are complicated questions. So hopefully, now you're more aware of the so-you're-saying trap when people ""assume the sale"" and of course, the smash technique. This moves us to the second section of this video which is how to persuade someone in these kinds of situations. And I will say, it seems to me that it doesn't look like Jordan is necessarily trying to change Cathy's mind but simply to debate in front of an audience. There are still some valuable tips to be gleamed from this video and a few things that I'd add First, do not straw man the other person's ideas even if they're doing it to you. And to be clear, I don't know if I mentioned this, straw manning is when you create a caricature of their ideas and then attack those rather than what they truly believe. Instead, show the other person that you are truly engaging in their real points, attempt to understand them, and sometimes this mean that you have to ask them to repeat themselves so that you can. Seven? Seven women... repeat that oneâ€” Seven women running the top FTSE 100 companies in the UK. Well, the first question might be. After you've made an honest attempt to understand them, you need to make sure that they can understand you which is necessary for persuasion. And to do that, you often have to use the visual imagery. For instance, here's a very abstract point without any images that Jordan makes. ...that it's inevitable that there will be continuity in the way that animals and human beings organize their structures. It's absolutely inevitable. And there is one-third of a billion years of evolutionary history behind that. Now, maybe you can understand that but it kind of lacks any emotional oomph. But notice how the addition of a concrete example makes that one-third of a billion years just feel different. That's so long that a third of a billion years ago, there weren't even trees; it's a long time. So adding concrete examples especially ones that people can easily imagine is a smart persuasive move and lastly, when you're arguing, oftentimes the best way to get someone to change their position is not by changing their mind but by gently showing them that they are already agreeing with you. I talked about this in the frame video but here's an example from this interview. Why should your rights to freedom of speech trump a trans-person's right not to be offended? Because in order to be able to think, you have to risk being offensive. I mean, look at the conversation we're having right now. You know, like, you're certainly willing to risk offending me in the pursuit of truth. Why should you have the right to do that? It's been rather uncomfortable. This is huge. Jordan is no longer arguing that her point is wrong; he's arguing that she already agrees with him â€” her behavior and her previous statements demonstrate that she cares more about free speech than not offending people. And then Jordan doesn't try to make this point wrong; he shows her how they're actually very much in alignment. You're doing what you should do which is digging a bit to see what the hell's going on. And I gave you what you should do but you're exercising your freedom of speech to certainly risk offending me. And that's fine. I think â€” more power to you as far as I'm concerned. And then of course Cathy feels stumped because she does actually agree with Jordan and she's proven it herself. People have a strong desire to remain consistent with things they've already said and done so oftentimes, this becomes one of the few ways to persuade someone who's really dug in their heels. You're basically showing them that they don't have to move in order to agree with you; they already do right where they're dug in. And then of course, Jordan hits her with the ""gotcha."" ...uh, and... [sighs] I'm just trying to work that out but I mean... [sighs] Jordan: Hah. Gotcha. Cathy: You have got me. You have got me. Even though I laughed at that phrase at the time I was watching the interview, I have to say that last bit ""gotcha"" does not improve Jordan\'s persuasive case. It actually makes Cathy feel silly and wrong as opposed to happy to discover that she and Jordan are really on the same team all along and if I had to give one last point of constructive criticism, it would be that Jordan answered all of Cathy's questions rather than trying to proactively address her deeper unstated emotional concern. And in my opinion, that emotional concern is that Jordan is her enemy â€” that if he believes something, it must be against her interests. If Jordan could have found that and pointed to a more common ground that they share which we all of course have, I don't think the interview would have continued in such an argumentative fashion but Jordan's role isn't necessarily to convince Cathy Newman of anything â€” it's to debate for an audience and to promote his book which I think he did at an A+ level.

571,"I mean very few people could ever imagine here we go 4 3 2 1 boom and we're live saddling up to that microphone young lady how are you I'm good how are you great to see you it's great to see you too thanks for meeting with my saying hi to my sons it sounds a great fuckin'-a they are man and that's what I figure is my next step in my in the tale my next chapter is what's her name the girl that everyone loves the girl the singer she's real tall and skinny Taylor Swift yeah I can't remember anybody's name anymore there's so many people to remember yeah well she said she's on to her next chapter and that's how I feel too and it's gonna be about how talking to women about how to raise functional sons this isn't this is needed in America and I'm gonna step up and do it because all these tales what with all the news and such obvious it's obvious to me these women have not raised their sons correctly and I'm going to correct them because I'm tired of them yapping in fucking bitch in the moanin I'm old I'm gonna tell you what to do to raise decent sons women well your son said something when when they were doing the little tour of the studio they saw the picture of Rosa Parks and your son said that's Rosa Parks and I said you one of the few people that ever just pointed that out and noticed it and he goes of course he goes Roseanne's my mom she raised me right that's sweet in that sweet that's something that's getting the what do you call it but I can't fucking do it well you obviously did a great job shout out shout I gave you a shout out shout out to the moms how you holding up everything good with you right now well I'm smoking like a bitch well I smoke every day was were you smoking before all this oh hell no what is currently secretly Doug Stanhope got me back on the bastard you son of a bitch I quit for like 15 years in Doug Stan hope snuck every time I see Doug I'd smoke one he's got an evil spell on me oh he's evil little man he's sober right now no cigarettes for him either yeah he always says that no he's doing so brougt over are y'all doing sober October yes Wow why didn't you ask me I would have sobered up for it would you no no you weren't it done no I want to do get fucked up I want to go to retox  that's what my boyfriend Johnny calls it guys it's time to read talks how many cigarettes you smoking today now well know who's counting you just keep smoking them not smoking less than 10 less than 10 is not bad yeah not smoking a lot see I'm cutting it by 10 every week okay so so next week it'll be down to one okay day all week what day's not bad and I'll see how I deal with it if anyone dies this whole thing has been completely fucking insane and you realize it yeah I know I want to tell you but you caught this madness his outrage culture right at the peak I think you you hit peak outrage culture thank you well people didn't give a fuck if you were making a joke you didn't give a fuck if you had no idea that that lady was black didn't give a fuck what your mental state was didn't give a fuck if you were on ambien didn't give a fuck if you were drinking didn't give a fuck if you want but they didn't care that you you sincerely apologized and did not didn't mean to offend you were cracking a joke about a woman it it was funny how they've mischaracterize didn't lied about it and added words to it yeah but yeah I like to talk about the tweak but yeah I seriously apologize to all whom I'm inadvertently offended and because they were offended for like it it wasn't even what they say they were because it didn't say that no but they think that I tweeted a said she looked like you know somebody and I never said anything about her looks it was a political tweet and it's just proof of how everybody's under mass mind control because they took a and of course I'm always interested in that you know you know that I'm a spy in control yeah I think about it self-imposed that's what I think I think people are under the wave of self-imposed mind-control I don't think it's like there's anybody poem you think you can get out of it no I don't think anyone's pulling the strings I don't think this is no I don't I don't think it's by design I think you're caught up in a wave of fear and paranoia and political correctness and I think one of the reasons why I attack they attack someone like you is first of all you're wealthy and successful and famous and be original you are beautiful thank you and one of the best comics of all time oh thank you and you're also you're you're an easy target you're a white woman well I don't identify as a white woman what do you identify us I identify as a Jew well there you go yeah and this is what you thought this woman was as well though she looks like my cousin Sharon she looks just like my cousin but it wasn't nothing to do with how she looks that came after my tweet but the most blasted about it was about the work of her hands what she engineered in Iran and I've been on there talking about the the I call it a woman's revolution in Iran for years and speaking to people in Iran about it and what it means to the women who are second-class citizens there and so if you take that one tweet out of like probably I tweet a lot yeah you know no I don't go crazy I stay crazy I admit it I mean what the fuck they're like you know what you've said you're crazy for years and you know what you're crazy well yeah I said it for years well it's also one of the crazy yeah all comics are fucking nuts Oh at least I don't wash my keys like some I know some guys they add they gotta wash their keys five six seven times where they can go onstage what's his name oh I'm so bad on names Chris Farley I always ask comics you know I asked him what's what's your secret number what's yours Joe well number you don't have a number no you don't have to do something a number of times you don't have a number what's your birthday eight eleven sixty seven eight what's that August 8 11 67 you were born in 1967 yes Jesus F Christ I was in the Mike I was in the Utah State Hospital when you were born what were you doing given birth no I was in a mental institution oh that was my first hospitalization it lasted for nine months and it was the Utah State Hospital improve oh where the Osmonds are from it's always a big Marie Osmond fan the the mental health aspect of this conversation is an important one because here's my take on this it's extremely important it is important and yesterday was Mental Health Awareness Day yes I know and I was quite aware of being mentally healthy yesterday as I was smoking if someone had cheese all I eat is cheese if someone has an injured leg you don't expect them to run marathons if someone has you know something wrong with their liver you don't expect them to process food correctly you don't blame it on them but if someone has a mental health issue and they do something erratic yeah or they say something that's inappropriate and then they apologize for it or if they're comedian or if they're comedian and you you've had legitimate real diagnosed treated mental health issues trauma related issues there you go so little I did they help you better can you yeah but for whatever reason people want to pretend that this is a deliberate act by a calculating person who is just being an asshole and that's not the case you're not actually not at this time huh I have been an asshole but you worried her but you weren't that's not what you were doing no I was talking about Iran and the woman's revolution there and how how and it's always been because you know what I had my DNA done because I wanted to know and I am of North African ancestry how much it's like a very small percentage but it was something like twenty five thousand years ago they left North Africa which is kind of Syria and they went to Lithuania and Russia and some Europe did you like 23andme or something yeah yeah and it just answered so many questions for you know why I feel this yearning towards that part of the world but I do you know and especially the geopolitics there are some have always intrigued me and I have always attempted to use my voice to you know support all the people there well it's a fastest so it was you know this one tweet was like about it was about I mean it's actually a genius tweet if you really fucking me what did you say what exactly did you say to us find the tweet Jamie I'll tell you if it's the artificially rendered there's an artificially rendered well yeah there's a lot of them what people distorted what you actually first it was racist Roseanne and then about couple weeks later it was disgraced comic Roseanne and her racist tweet and then after that it was disgraced comic and her offensive racist wheat because there's all these hoops you got to jump through you know they're never done punishing you well like we're saying before the man said don't apologize too social justice warriors because that's the kiss of death that's fucking chumming the water blood in the water you know it's definitely a little bit of that but what I was saying before the podcast to you is I don't I don't really what I really think happens is they find a target yeah and they don't care if it's a viable target but once the target gets greenlit they go after you until some new target comes along until the target and it's recreational outrage they find they attack you and they go after you and know what the fuck you said right and obviously they don't that's what kind of cracks me up is like they look at this look what they're saying it meant and you know I'm not going to bow down before them and say you were right and they want me to but they weren't right I'm right I wrote it bitch so I know what I meant so you don't forget to tell me what I meant but they don't care and that's the thing is they don't want to look at it rationally and say oh here's a woman that has a history of mental health problems she was on ambien and drinking and she says something that is slightly irrational but given your explanation of it you both always think all my tweets make no sense you've been saying that for the fucking year since I went on Twitter you're like her tweets are just button straight-up crazy well you have you crazy tweets for sure I don't think they're crazy you just don't get them well maybe if I was in the same mindset as you I would get him yeah but obviously no one when I say crazy I think they're I know I don't think like other people I know that I've always known that my whole life I'd always test other people to see what they were thinking like as even as a kid I'd be like you know but I try to fit in they go let's play Barbies you know and I'm like a fucking I don't want to you know I'm like okay well but let's have Barbie be a resistance fighter that paratroops into you know I into the hidden lines of the German thing and save all the Jews and they'd go you have to be her cousin skipper then they'd have me the skipper doll I always had to personify skipper and they got to be Barbie I didn't even know if Barbie had a cousin yeah skipper she has a little tiny too and I resented that because I always had very large pendulous breasts since I was four or five I did I don't I don't think or look like other people I am an alien really what planet you think you'd be from well somebody told matters from Pleiades do you know anything about that yeah that's the people that call our Bell show they would always say this yeah yeah Hades yeah they say round faces are from Pleiades see you got a round face that's what I told you I don't even go by what people look like except for I do look at the shape of their head I have to admit that's how I classify people I classify people my own way cuz I don't think like everybody else thinks I take a person's shape of their head and that's the group they represent to me and I have noticed that the Dutch have the largest head the big people the Dutch have pure score not all of them of course but some of them you know the average height for a Dutch person like 6 feet tall I know the way my huge folks yeah Vikings yeah Vikings yeah I love all the different peoples of the earth because they all have a variety of foods that I enjoy so I like to you know I don't just mix with one kind of person in my real life I mix with all kind of people and you know up I'll go anywhere for a free meal but I don't but I love I love cultures and I love all people that's all I want to say you know I wouldn't have I'm not that person so you're not you're not a racist by any stretch of the imagination but you are a person that is an through I'm a misanthrope you are a misanthrope but I'm a respect receive no man or woman but most comedians yeah we're all like that was a misanthropic intentions or you have to hate on people the same but you definitely have to mock and make them it's part of your job description yeah that mom can make fun of and you you look for things that are irritating about everything no shit right that's not only that that was part of your character on your show yeah it was part of the reason why ABC on you back it's part of the reason why the show became such a giant hit in its return I mean it was a fucking huge hit coming right out of the gate yeah 28 million people that's a lot of fucking panels number one every episode yeah that's a lot of people and a lot of that was because people love this aspect of you but as soon as you get labeled a racist everybody throws their hands up it goes whoa I didn't know she was racist she's racist and they don't care about nuance they don't care about the details they don't care about ambien they don't care about alcohol when I called you on the phone it was the first thing I one thing I've learned Joe if you're gonna take an ambien don't not do not drink a beer always only drink a wine yes with ambien I have a good friend of mine who is one of the nicest most respectful guys you ever want to meet he woke up in Germany on a plane covered in his own vomit with the police standing over him asking him if he knew what happened he wound up getting arrested they brought him to the the jail in Germany and they out and he's a CEO of a large company and they went over things with him and they said what happened what do you remember he goes well I remember taking an ambien and then I went to sleep then I had I guess I had a beer at some point in time and they go okay stop this is what happened and so they described how he was hitting on the stewardesses and trying to start fights with men in the cabin oh he's being as well free so wasn't his being his real self he was on ambien yeah I know a distorts things he's the nicest guy if you knew this guy you would never in a million years believe that he was capable of anything remotely like this and the German people actually let him stay in the country they let him continue his vacation they're like okay forgave and he promised not to do that again he was I'm never fucking taking that shit again in my life yeah and one of the things that I said to you when I called you up I said what were you doing well and you told me you were on ambien and I said okay we'll stop right there because I know quite a bit about that cuz I've had personal experiences with friends that have had real issues with ambien I had a bit I did in my act about a friend of mine who literally made a meal while I was on ambien cooked supported right what God food cool look at Tiger Woods that he was on that and then you'd go driving off in the golf cart to meet some chick you know and that I don't understand what people said they have sex on ambien people say that's a big thing that people take ambien to have sex I don't even know how they can stay I thought yes they don't stay awake but another part of them wakes up and they're sex part comes out that's all I can figure I've never taken it I'm terrified of this don't ever take yeah I did no I have no problem going to sleep I've never had a price but you know what I found is THC they sell it down it the dispensary and there's one for sleep at night yeah I've been doing that and I've been sleeping through the night when I was taking the sleeping thing to sleep and drug ambien well I don't want to say it cuz we don't want to get some eye candy man you know I say it three times you don't get sued not me by saying ambien I bet you they give a fuck did you see that did you see that yeah well you know I had Hamilton Morris on the podcast who was a drug expert yeah and he writes for vice and it does pieces for Vice and he went I just did a piece for Vice after your incident he came on and went in great detail about how there that that is something that happens to people that were they have no idea what the fuck they're saying it's called a hypnotic that is the classification of drugs that it falls under and people do all sorts of involuntary things when they're on it no it doesn't just make you say racist things but you didn't say I think it's actually racist know about the work of Valerie Jarrett's hands and I also was referencing my very favorite movie so if we could talk about how fuckin awesome that movie Planet of the Apes great fucking movie also it's the definitive people get your come on people now it's not allowing you bud it's like come on it's like the hundredth monkey is that the thing is that the name of it yeah that's what it is the hundredth monkey on the typewriter is the thousand much what is it how does that work that if you have a certain amount of my hundredth monkey that changes everything right if B if if a species does something 99 times in a row the hundredth time it's gone into their DNA oh yeah yeah and then they evolve to a next level hundredth monkey effect this monkey effect it's a hypothetical phenomenon which new behavior idea is come claim to spread rapidly by unexplained means from one group to all related groups once a critical number of members of one group exhibit a new behavior or acknowledge the new idea yeah yeah well the thing is a lot of people put pictures of that woman no picture the picture was put up after my tweet I understand well I do I'm not gonna do with that picture I didn't say she looked like anything I seriously I'm not that fucking shallow okay I never talked about nobody's looks unless they're like thin and blonde and I'm jealous but you know and youthful now but or whatever wasn't there another tweet that you made a long time ago about who was that other woman Susan Rice yes yeah well you said she has giant swinging eight balls yeah that she's a man Wow let me explain that now because this is the regional istic regionalism I'm from Utah and all the girls in Utah when we got married and aren't we heard our moms do it - it's always where's your ape they go what's your ape doing this Sunday and he's like oh he's watching football all good let's go out to lunch you know is all of the men we're all Apes that's how it is in a breeder culture like Salt Lake City breeder called yeah it's like where's your ape and there's like man your ape has a big fucking swing and eight balls I give him that you know it's a regional istic thing and you know so I used it and apologized but you know I didn't really you know I just sometimes forget what race everybody is as if I could tell after time anyway I even see people to tell you the truth I need like bifocals trifocals and I never identified other human beings by what they looked like for God's sake I just could tell if I felt a liking to him you know whatever they look at my point is that there's only two things over the course of thousands my point I said Susan Rice let's say that she has she has incredible audacity that's what I meant and she does but you didn't mean it in a complimentary way if someone is audacious is that negative or positive we talked weren't you talking about her in a negative way though I said she has a lot of audacity that's what I meant mmm okay she does whatever it was that's a lot but that was one that got brought up as well that was also in the middle of a huge conversation about you know Benghazi and the Iran deal those are the two things are two of the three things that I like to do on Twitter although I'm no longer on there you got off yeah bad for you yeah I was glad to see Kanye West got off two did he yeah what deleted all his accounts last week and I was glad to cuz you're just like once you're a target it's just too painful yeah well you definitely shouldn't be reading that shit no I don't read it yeah but well when you become a target how do you know if you don't read it well I'd know what I'd lived through when it first happened and that's been like four or so months ago so I just know how I've reacted in my locker real life since that happened to me how long it take for this die-off to die off slow down where they weren't just coming after you constantly like I told you that news crews when they found out that you were gonna come on the podcast the first time they were trying to show up at my house they were trying to show up at the studio they were trying to find me at The Comedy Store yeah I mean they were just trying to hunt down yeah anything about you I know I've sneaking cigs from my boyfriend at my mom's house when I did it you know we were at home in Salt Lake City when I tweeted at 2:11 am I just woke up into it I had this thought in my head oh my god this can make so much sense and then I tweeted it and I went right back to sleep and when I woke up at 7 this shit hit the fan you know yeah but I was like I'm going to expound on this later there was one of those kind of things right you just want to get it down and I you know always slept with my computer and tweet when I wake up like you know when you're old you have to go to the bathroom a lot saw his tweet and fall back to sleep see and I and then on the ambien tweets my daughter I used to always when I took my ambien I called my daughter and she or she called me she goes mom you you're starting to do the ambien tweets get off get off the Twitter you know but I saw I just called my daughter then every night when I when I was doing the ambien and I'd go you know what here comes a big fish she recorded it here comes a big fish right through my window oh oh he's getting stuck in the mirror and that's what she goes mom turn it all off I have my family telling me that I almost need her standing guard by your bed yeah hold on let me read that before you tweet it no no no that's what she does now she don't she took my Twitter account away will you sir program she tweets all these liberal things that I want to get just get up in her face and smack her around for not with you know on her own but I'm like how come it's okay for you to say this but it ain't for me well mother I didn't lose everything oh sorry trying to help you oh my god I hear for you and your fucking help sticks in your face is just this year a serious liberal they all off three and my daughters are serious social justice warrior types and what do they think about your positions well they think I'm a frigging crate they think I'm crazy they always did like you know they always thought all my choice for president were crazy but then oddly they were all very supportive when I personally ran for president in 2012 they were really supportive of me well you're there mom yeah that was cool but like all the other times it's like oh god mother it's your generation it's a baby boomers are the reason everything is all fucked up so stop letting yourself off the hook Oh political conversation that's in the bar household yeah oh yeah oh yeah what what was it that when you first got brought into a mental hospital what was it about well I had got hit by a car and the the hood ornament went in my head in my brains and scrambled them and I I used to be an a-plus math student I was just great in geometry oh my god I loved geometry I got straight A's and then you know I sort of fell apart after that took a long time to heal from it and you know how much did your personality change oh it changed drastically but you know you read all that stuff about traumatic head injuries now because I do read a lot and talk to a lot of football players who have the same thing and we do discuss it yeah you change right away yeah it's still you but it's like a it's kind of like an art 'el artificial intelligence you do you find that did you find that you became much more impulsive oh yeah yeah you know right well yeah here's what happened I was crossing the street on my way to school how old were you hmm I was 16 no it's 15 going to first week of high school and I was a big nerd and anyway I was crossing the street and it was the top of the hill and this woman girl she was on her way the University and the Sun blinded her and she ran me over and the rest is history how how long were you in the hospital for mmm so first he's must've been you must have been in a medical hospital first and then you were admitted to a mental hospital well there was about three months in between right but I was in the hospital for a while you know and I had a head concussion and a brain concussion and I had hamburger meat four legs so they did all these what do they call them skin grafts on my legs and yeah I was in there for awhile then I came out of there and I had forgotten everything about math when I returned to school where's matter of weeks after that maybe two months I I'm really bad on time now but uh and I had forgotten all my math and it was just terrible that was a big depressive depression I went into because I couldn't remember I couldn't remember things you know and also became way more impulsive then I was like I don't know what I did then I started going really out there into the ethers I went way out there like how so way out you know how you go way out do you ever go way out no I'm really I'm I've had a lot of head injuries oh yeah I've been into it not terrible mostly just punches and kicks nothing like car accident yes sir never played football yeah but my head injuries have you know they were just more of cumulative when I was young till I was about 21 22 I stopped stop fighting stop sparring mm-hmm but nothing but I definitely I'm subject to impulsive behavior still yeah keep it under wraps I keep it under control because I'm aware of it but when I was younger I didn't understand who's going on I would just be subject to whims very addictive behavior but I tried to keep it positive but I would be addicted to things addicted to doing things addicted games addicted like ridiculously addictive like spend 10 12 14 hours a day playing video games that sounds like my kid yeah just normal because video games are awesome but yeah it would be for me be everything martial arts pool whatever do is I'll just be completely obsessed with it and to be thinking about it all day in port where it wasn't necessarily healthy yeah just on a whim I would just want to go do something I just I almost had no control over compulsions mm-hmm you know and I think some of that is whatever brain injuries that I've had are very mild in comparison to a lot of people that I know certainly very mild in comparison to yours there was a lot of trauma in the State Hospital that you know I'm like you know being there and seeing and experiencing and how long nine months so what was it that they brought you in there for what was how are you behaving that they decided that you needed to be admitted I was out there you say that like what does that mean um I don't think there's any words the English you just can't understand didn't have a control of reality you didn't have control of your behavior your thinking was screwed up I was you know not thinking like the normal thing that they say you should be thinking about and but people around you had realized it that it was it was so bad that they had to admit you to a hospital wasn't just that Oh Roseann she's eccentric it was she needs actual medical help yeah I asked to be admitted do you knew something was really wrong yeah I finally admitted it was did you know at the time were you completely aware that it was connected to your car accident no you just knew something was wrong yeah and back then they didn't really kind of understand that the way they understand it now no they didn't understand too much about bipolar disorder or they knew nothing about multiple personality disorder trauma related traumas related yeah PTSD now they call everything pts yeah they don't even say Dee anymore they say pts mmm post-traumatic stress so when they admitted you what was the treatment like what did they do to you when you were inside the mental hospital  well they right away put me on an anti-psychotic what was it do you remember Mallory what did that do I don't know I went in there there you were gone I was gone I was just watching these people I was in the mental institution with and I want to tell that story no cuz there was this one lady I think I told this to Paul Reubens - I think it might be where he got Large Marge there's a swine lady and she's in this cage you know if she's in a cage with keys on her ward there and Christ I can't remember her name either Marge her man was Marge yeah and she's about 600 700 pounds whoa and she's funnier than hell you know I thought good man this this chicks got some good lines you know and I it's traded lines with her and she'd laugh you know yeah you know I was like jokes you can always find a joke wherever you are you know that's the key to life I think but um so she oh everybody called me chunky that was my name chunky and there was another girl in there named shorty so it was chunky and shorty we were like a duo but anyway um so she's like hey Roseanne get what's-her-name's keys when they go to dinner and open this up here you know come in here and I'm like okay you know cuz you know after all I was crazy too and I don't like trust I don't know I just always I never questioned that there was danger anywhere I always got in trouble you know caught beat up something you know but uh so I did it you know and I can't Oh uncle that was her name the head nurse I hated her cuz she told me I needed to bathe I'll tell that story later it was horrifying it changed my life but anyway so they all go to dinner so I go in there steal the keys out of the thing where they are you know the attendants and not go in there with Marge and I leave the keys in the door and close the door  yeah so I'm like hey Marge you know how's it going Marge ha ha and she's like chunky you know why they put me in this cage don't you take some joggers over I go what why no I don't know why  well chunky it's because they consider me to be dangerous I'm like how calm I am I'm like Gomer Pyle seriously I'm total golden you're like 16 at the time 15 about 8 minutes into it I realized oh shit oh shit something's going on here that's how long it always took me like to zero in on what's happening guys I'm not even there you know I'm always ignoring when other people talk I don't listen funny thing you know yeah so I'm always in my own head I never get out really except for when I work but uh so then it got then it took a turn you know she's like um so it got to why do they consider you dangerous you know I had to ask it cuz she kept on getting me there to that point well she wanted me to ask it I was trying to delay it you know cuz I knew they'd be back in 40 minutes and it was like going on 20 now she goes I'm in here because that's my voice I got to do what Marjorie I'm in here because I broke a couple attendance bags didn't they tell you that like no my hat how'd you do that and in my head I'm thinking don't change don't miss a beat don't miss a breath don't look nowhere just to keep on act no you know Utah Utah girl did you knew she was dangerous well that's when it hit my head that it was hah oh she's talking about you know I'm a I'm feeling like prey right you know  and I go how to do that cuz I figure oh it's an accident you know it's good ol Marge she sells good jokes she goes well it's easy you just know I'm doing me again I gotta do her it's easy you just put one hand here and one hand here and then you're like oh where'd you learn that I'm changing the subject 100 how was your mom what was a school like you went to put your favorite book what's your favorite color what kind of ice cream you like you ever seen that there's worms in the oatmeal you ever noticed that she started got that one got her she's like I did I did notice there's crawling motherfuckers I go yeah next fret dusting eat that this this one you know I like suddenly I'm transported to a confederacy of dunces when he's on the thing against Levi's pants remember that rant that book so I'm just tap dancing really and then I hear it click I grab I got up fumbled the keys out of the door put him back in the attendance room went my room when you said you hear click yeah I knew the first door got open there was two doors I heard the first door open and they're coming back from from dinner so you got away supposed to be sick you know in my room what so I didn't go to do yeah some is laying there and that was like daily I mean there were so many weird people in there we had this one girl Rosie her name was where she'd always grabbed she always end up with a pair of real sharp scissors and lunch for someone's throat where'd you get them springing her them scissors you know but anyway I went on my antipsychotic medicine and that was good that I was on there for the shade I saw nobody saving my friends hanging and stuff like that sorry friends hanging yeah in the mental institution so I saw worse than that would you say I I saw you know victims of abuse terrible by the guards know of kids coming you know Oh victims of abuse that came in that were mentally scarred like that yeah yeah now when they put you on antipsychotics was because you were exhibiting psychotic behavior last what kind of psychotic behavior while they thought it was psychotic I was just scared that they I think I was throwing them off cuz I wanted to think I was I caught it I didn't want to thank them to think I was schizophrenic I knew enough not to let them near me they if cuz what you got the once you got the diagnosis of schizophrenic they would or no shit shocks and they'd experiment on you basically you're a new guinea pig and I didn't want that so maybe I get you know and then you know so yeah I I was doing weird things like walking down the middle of streets after hit by the car I walk down the middle of streets I don't know I thought oh you gotta get over your fear of crossing the streets that's what was in my head and then I'd walk down a highway you know I was in a whole other realm it was like a real surrealistic and metaphysical realm and I I grew comfortable there but you know I think most artists writers and performers are in that world I mean we got a toe in it at least I've got in and out you know depending on you know now I think I'm on the right medications that help me there's a lot of comedians that have similar stories yeah some of the grades you know Kinnison has a similar story - you know he was hit by a car and changed his personality radically and it happened in a similar age it happened when he was young as well and he was one person then he get hit by a car and then after the car he's his wild man yeah wild didn't give a fuck Wow totally impulsive it's not that I didn't give a fuck it said I just thought different doctor I I was just um I don't know my mom says when I was 18 months old I used to go out in the street and direct cars we lived on a highway and you know that she'd come to find me there just 18 months all the holding up my hands Jesus Christ and stopping traffic it's always had a weird thing going there but uh you know I don't know I think I watched too much of that police show you know where they'd stop traffic I used to love TV shows and think they were real some of it how many people do you think know this about your mental health history you know anybody who knows me I don't think very many people know it that we're angry at you oh yeah they did I don't think they did yeah they did I think I don't think people look past the surface I think they looked at you as a rich white lady who said something that they considered to be racist and they decided they were gonna attack you and then the perception the optics of this it was the reason why ABC canceled the show the reason why it was ABC right yeah yeah it's the reason why they canceled the show is the reason why everybody pulled back away from you and what did that feel like when nobody defended you people who should know you the way I know you and I defended you from the very beginning because I said no my son told me I might thank you this is not a racist person I go this is a woman who's kind of crazy he's brilliant hilarious yes this is why I love you well you know they try to outlaw comedy that's what I think well I was surprised that more comics didn't say nothing because you know they I don't know they're scared people they're scared to support someone that they consider to be racist yeah I mean I got a lot of shit from it but I don't give a fuck they can think what they want and call me what they want it don't change me it doesn't change you well it just takes time before the dust settles and I knew that once I knew that once you and I talked if you and I sat down and talked like this people would get a chance to see who you really are you know well you know they may not like me I don't have to you're not a bad person you've never been a bad person no I'm not a bad person but I've done bad things and like I was talking to you know I'm a name-dropper i I hate to drop his name I'll but forgive me I should have asked him first but you know I was talking to Mike Tyson you know and he's been through some stuff and you're like well the thing is you got it you got it become a pacifist that's that's your only yeah don't battle with people don't know you can't battle with people back and forth on line you know I mean um there's too many people there's not enough time and you'll go crazy you'll get wrapped up in conflict and you'll just be involved in it every minute of every day yeah I call it feeding the beast yeah because that really is Tower of Babel Twitter well it's it's definitely a strange strange environment where all these people just they don't even know you they have no contact with you other than your this person they could reach and get to react to certain lines and the more explosive and the the the more derogatory and insulting the lines they say to you the more impact it's gonna have on you so that flavors the way they communicate with you yeah it was tough working with a lot of social justice warriors and remaking Roseanne it was tough on me mentally so when you mean like the staff that you were working with look I was the only one saying I'm not a Republican nor am I fucking Democrat I'm an independent and I'm just anti-corruption I'm just anti corruption don't don't make me into your idea of Who I am there's no idea who you were well they thought that since I support a president Trump that I was you know a racist in a scumbag and you know anti everything just cuz I voted for him why did you support Trump I love what Norm Macdonald said if I can quote him can I quote no please do it well says it better than anything he said the American people I hated Hillary so bad that they voted for a guy they hated even worse I just don't rub it in that is Norma Donald that's brilliant you know true I wasn't I wasn't for Hillary and I was a woman and that was like a big no-no right that's bellick basically comes down to yeah because it was a woman's turn but you know I'm anti I just want a government that works for the American people the type a taxes and I expect something from my taxes and you know here's news to all of them out there including POTUS I think it's some time the American people need to audit what happened to their tax monies and I think we should all have a say in what this country does with our hard-earned dollars and don't just assume you speak for us because obviously you don't or we wouldn't have a trade deficit of twenty trillion dollars so STFU and let the American people handle what they should handle in this country it's a republic and it's runs on the on the consent of the governed and it's really really time to talk about that now when you say social justice warriors that you had to work with like specifically what were the issues that you were dealing with well Trump was the big elephant in the room my support for Trump and they're just they're patronizing shite can I call it yeah well we have to remember that the I mean I'm gonna paraphrase but it was a lot well you know the ignorant unwashed people who voted for Trump it's not their fault that was kind of what it was like mmm and because I said well you know it was working-class people that elected Trump so I I really can't I can't let you say that to me cuz it's not true you know they already had in their head what it means and of course they are wrong like they're wrong about you know this being about a you know that cabin on being about abortion rights they're wrong about that too so you know how are they wrong about that cuz I don't think you know he said pretty much that you know you can't overturn something that's in law Roe vs. Wade yeah yeah but you know they fear monger to get everybody thinking that's what they were after and I don't think it is what they were I don't think that is why they wanted to I think they're concerned with anything that Trump's trying to pass anyone that Trump's trying to get to the Supreme Court any any bills at Trump's trying to boil and they should put on their adult pants and get involved and make sure that he represents you know the will of the people of this country you have to become involved in the process then but don't just sit there on your butt criticizing everybody and calling everybody names that that's really not any kind of a justice warrior that's all phony you got to get involved right now when you were first approached about doing a Roseanne relaunch when they came to you how did this all take place and did you get to pick the people that you work with  I had already said about a year prior to that that I supported Trump over Hillary and it was like you know a big it was in all the papers in Hollywood help how could she and you know this and that the other but it didn't seem to bother the American people know my audience you know you know I always tried to make content for the audience not for the critics right and not for the industry not for the industry you know the industry is ruthlessly left like in down to the point where it's not even a thinking thing it's just like they automatically go left because that's the way you're accepted in this town that's the way you stay working that's the way you stay invited to all the good part that's the way that certain Stalinist types in show business keep it you know you know everything about the media is tightly controlled in Hollywood so when they came who came to you with the relaunch how did it how does it happen that they did a sketch on Sara's talk show and everyone liked it and Sarah called me and said she said John said he's in if you you know if you're in so you say Bob Johnson of course is Laurie yeah Laurie's in okay yeah let's do it so what who turned on you after this was over um well I'm my coven of lawyers advises I not get into this at this time that's you know I'd say it self-explanatory well people could find out yeah I don't know that they turned on me I think it was always that way since you know I came in and said I said somebody on the show has to be a trump supporter none of them would do it I'm like it's a great role you know yeah you could do it you're the kind of person who wouldn't pen they were like no so I said okay well then I'll do it because you know I did both for him and everybody knows it well people forget Archie Bunker it's one of the greatest characters in history sitcoms nobody wants to be the quote unquote you know other person a bad guy in Hollywood or you know be the other in Hollywood yeah but you know I I was up for it I thought it would be great I thought it would be you know I get some lines in there from the other side once in a while you know I let him say all they want to say I never told them don't say that about him don't diss Annette like the day of the filming you know I'd been saying you know I let my writers do their writing you know but I lay out all the stories or approve them you know and so it was that first show and I'm waiting for a line about Hillary I go I let you have seven Trump jokes in this show and you can't even one fuckin Hillary joke it didn't want a Hillary Joe no what was the Hillary joke do you remember I said you better get me a Hillary joke I did I go it ain't about you your name ain't on this show what did they say about it like why did they not want a Hillary joke did they have an explanation for it no but everybody knew they wanted Hillary yeah they felt it would go against their morals to say that there's another way to vote or to acknowledge that you know half the country voted that way or that she's extremely flawed well at that point they didn't care that's what's weird about it isn't it yeah things where there's a complete denial of reality that's like this is not there's nothing to do with women has nothing to do with liberals it is another you're talking about an extremely flawed person well I don't I'm not gonna talk about her as a person I just talk about her concepts and her voting a necklace not even used word person politician extremely flawed politician with a background of deep corruption and lies demonstratable lies like this we're not talking about some amazing gem you know well let's just put it like this a lot of us people who liked Bernie voted for Trump yes yeah well especially when they found out when Donna Brazil's book came out they found out what they had done to Bernie during the primaries yeah it's dark shit yeah it's dark that that just everybody was like whatever whatever they said nobody I'll vote for a Jew they do use that one hilarious in the cell to this day mm-hmm to this day they're still doing stupid shit like that but you know I didn't want her even though she's a woman but you know I did wonder in 2008 I wanted her not Obama cuz I liked her health care plan better at that time when I was still you know I had before I walked away so um you know they're doing a whole March I might show up a March for what walk away walk away from what the Democrat Party who is they who's doing this a whole bunch of kids youths and what's the October 27th that the cross from the White House they're gonna walk from the DNC to that Park there and make statements but walking away to wear to an independent party no they're they're Batarian they're going Republican Republican that's what's bizarre the polar opposites the right and the left to blue and the red and all those guys golf together let's cut through the bullshit they're all making deals and scratching each other's back whether from one party or the other come on well Trump paid Clinton to be at his wedding he did yeah while that smart you got a photo op and a half out it out night I mean he paid those people forever it's one of the reasons why when when he was campaigning they he had you know so much animosity towards them and towards the system that he was a part of for so long he was a Democrat most of his life I know well he's getting me he's getting it too but uh that just proves it right there you know you they give money to both parties you know in Hollywood they don't just get it the Democrats party together the Republican Party too but they stay silent about that well it's kind of smart to cover your bets you know which government contractor couldn't be able to dip into me and isn't that like what Hollywood's really all about well there's so many levels to it right I mean there's the the blatant tribalism of right versus left where people pick a side and they adopt a predetermined pattern or behavior and they adopt a conglomeration of I download the program yes yeah and they're just BOTS exactly they pair it and then below the surface you got geopolitical aspirations and you have the global war machine yeah yeah I'm that's that's what you have the the money the real money but you know what Joe I always say and people call me a pea and whatever they call me but I'd I have optimism and I've said for a long time when when the right people are at the controls of all the machinery and technology that will be so great for Humanity yeah we have it right within our grasp to you know make sure that this is a good place for all kids we could do that tomorrow so I think we should start thinking about that and all this artificial intelligence that gets us fighting with each other let's just step out of it like the matrix you know let's go to a new place where we're about solutions and working together bringing this country together and getting some real good jobs real good health care things that we pay taxes for better streets good education the things we pay taxes for yeah and mental health most of all I think that's what we need to protect for our veterans they come back and they're they're untreated and they won't even give them marijuana which really helps they won't even legalize that for you know people who have pts and marijuana does help with pts and you know you know talk about supporting our troops 22 of them a day are killing themselves they're homeless I mean that that's who we are I don't want that to be who we are come on they people think nobody can see us and what we do but they do and they they want it right people want things to be right and worked and used for the good of all people and stop tearing people apart from each other we're neighbors you know that was why I wanted to go back to the Roseanne show and say all those things and I'm so happy that I did I did it in 9 episodes I wanted a 10th season and I did all-night episodes were exactly the episodes I wanted to do so and it was number one every week and I just think my fans for that know you know a turn of fortune but I did what I wanted to do and and it was so gratifying it so wonderful and I don't want that to be forgotten I don't want that ninth season to disappear I mean the tenth season to disappear what do you think about them doing it without you how fucking weird is that it is weird I'm like oh I get it they're sending me a subtle message to OD on opioids is that what you think yeah that's some of it mind-control stuff yeah so you think that they want you to kill yourself well I don't know why they would do what they did let's just put it that way it doesn't make any sense I just I just think they're being completely inconsiderate they don't care about you know they don't and they they so belittled my contribution to the show to it just you know was shocking that was the most painful part of the whole thing well one of the things that I read was that you hadn't considered the more than 100 people that work on the show when you did what you did and I'm like that is that's a ridiculous statement I didn't cancel the show but not only did you not cancel the show you were on ambien drunk tweeting the idea that you did this this was some sort of a deliberate ploy to get the show canceled or the idea that there was any justification that your show could be canceled at all like what you can't just say something that you you didn't want to come out that way and apologize for it for three months no yeah they don't know who you are no they tried to wipe me off the off the map of the culture because people are scared to be connected with anybody who's a target yeah and they acted like cowards I wouldn't have done I mean if it were my friend definitely I would have of years two decades or more I would have said something but that's just me and I definitely one thing I would never have done is stab somebody in the rush to condemn somebody who you know was my biggest advocate there was a one sometimes an only advocate there was a lot of that I saw a lot of that yeah that's about them it's just about them it's not about me I just let go of all of it because you know I I am a person of belief and I just always tried to do what's right in front of me I feel like what you know my higher intelligence place in front of me I'll do it and because it knows better than me and which is why I don't think like other people but and also that I was not going to fight not at 66 I'm too old I I'm pretty frail and I think you know I worked really hard to get a second season and it's kind of ironic I crossed time zones to do promotion for free for months and you know during that time one year old and you can't sleep and you're crossing time zones going from Hawaii to New York and back and then back again and back again you know you know I kind of became dependent on ambien and I you know almost every night took it and you know obviously I something was wrong because I I didn't think I thought that tweet was about a science fiction movie which happens to be my favorite movie and which i think is very apt in in the world today particularly in Iran we're just a small group of corrupt leaders are oppressing the citizens and I think it I think there's a lot of references in that movie that to go along with what's happening in Iran of the human beings rising up to throw over their to overthrow their overlords and that's how I was looking at the whole thing so when I woke up to tweet there that was what was in my head it was certainly not somebody's looks and it was also about the Arab Spring in Egypt which which you know Obama he didn't handle it right and so all those things are interrelated with Iran and the Iran deal the Iran nuclear deal you know I'm I'm extremely well-read on that subject I certainly wouldn't be at the height of my power and my fame being on there going home so buddy needs like a Yankee excuse me I'm not an idiot okay I went beyond their GDP naked monkey I'm a well-read an intelligent woman and my word and things that I write to people over in that part of the world there I've brought a lot of people together in that part of the world with my tweets and most of my tweets are you know spiritual in nature anyway so it wasn't what people thought it was and still I apologize for inadvertently hurting anyone's feelings still I apologize for inadvertently and not you know be I apologize that they were wrong and they misheard it and misunderstood it but that wasn't good enough either and you know just get to a point where it go I'm letting go of it my fans who know me and my family and people who like me and know me for my life they know who I am and that's all that matters you know they can call me whatever they want I don't accept their definition of that word and I think that they should read more well one of the things that's most shocking about this outrage culture that we live in right now this age of outrage is that there's no path to redemption there's there's no acceptance of their IDs there is though via but there's not from the general public oh yeah the public everywhere I went people run up to me I never felt so much love in my entire career in real life but not on Twitter and not on social media not on social media social media it magnifies the very worst aspects of humanity because you're not interacting with people in the real flesh right you're not experiencing social cues you're not looking them in the eye you're not seeing them as a person you're just seeing them as a target online well I think that Twitter app has is a purposeful plan like Facebook I got our Facebook years ago cuz I realized what they were doing what do you think Twitter's doing he was doing the same thing that Facebook did how so it's manufacturing consent and you know using bots to do it I'm thinking about manufacturing consent it's a place where like Noam Chomsky says you know the press manufacturers consent the consent of the governed so that's what they're doing is manufacturing the consent of the governed but they also manufacture dissent they control the opposition to on Twitter and I'd like getting in between those two and causing a ruckus because I knew it was all artificial intelligence anyway it's all just to track us we all know that just like they do in China so what are you saying you think there's some sort of a grand plan to get people to argue with each other yeah I think it's a social experiment to turn one group against another which you know it's smart because it's divide and conquer and as long as we're like you know it's all these people getting robbed all these taxpayers getting robbed sitting there pointing to other taxpayers that are getting robbed and blaming them but nobody everybody needs to look upward of our government asked for an audit of our tax doesn't actually take responsibility for the things our country does we're getting judged for it anyway I think the certain what we allow realizing I think there's certainly people that are capitalizing on all this chaos and all this all the conflict but I don't think it's manufactured I don't think it's engineered I just think it's happening yes this is a new thing this this ability has a mind of its own I think people have a mind of their own people are inherently tribal there's almost no way to stop them from being tribal these smart people are tribal but the problem with tribalism is that you sometimes have enemies that are unnecessary so you develop this or you could have your or you could have allies yes on common ground well that would be nice if we all looked at ourselves as a tribal world that's how I do look at the world and why I didn't want Hillary Clinton because her party is very much for corporate law and the Republican Party is very much for tribal law and I am a tribal person and I think tribal people should you know have their land tribal in what way how he tribal me yeah well I'm Jewish  when I go over there to the Middle East I visit the graves of my teachers that's how I'm tribal I go to their graves and you know that's what we do that's what all indigenous people do they want to control their sacred bait burial grounds and that is anti-corporate law and that's why I'm anti corporate law I can't I'd like to study papal bulls and corporate law and maritime law and all that kind of stuff you know I like to read so I have a lot of information and you know it makes me angry or sad was more it that that the work of an artist over 30 years you think they think that we just pull that out of their ass and that they can copy it you know without the artist they can copy it you mean your show I do yeah and it it is you know all the stuff I suffered in my life I put into that show that show is about my family my children and it's just like wow that it's so huge it's so huge it's it's beyond entitled but what are they gonna what is their plan and how are they able to do that did you let them yeah I signed off Why ask me - why'd you sign off because I felt like I would be a huge hypocrite to have talked 30 years or more in my life about labor rights and the rights of working people if I took away those people 200 people's jobs so that's why I did it I wanted him to work I know how they had planned on another season and they probably I'd already spend the money was there any consideration of redemption was there any path where they could allow you to apologize or do something that would endear yourself to the people were they for that I said let me go on all your ABC shows and explain my tweet and how it was a political and not a racial tweet and you know that was denied me it's like you can't say anything till you sign off you can't say anything until you sign off so they wanted you to sign off the rights and then they would have you do whatever you wanted to do go on their interview shows no they didn't guarantee that didn't guarantee that so they just wanted you to sign off and they offered you nothing in return they offered me some money but the idea was just to be able to redo the show yeah to take all those years of my ideas and how I thought of 20 years of those situations to come back it took me 20 years to figure how would these characters where would they be now and I did that by living among regular and normal people for 20 years I never lived behind you know racially segregated gates like other stars I lived in working people for neighborhoods and I farm around farmers and I wasn't gonna be that big of a hypocrite like macadamia nut farm I sure do it's gorgeous you should come and see it I love to come see it I love the Big Island isn't it gorgeous amazing people are done there though today you know what I read some people some lady took a boat full of people too close to the volcano to look at it and the lava overtook their boat and thank God no man were killed but they were got like about two feet up on the cloth oh jesus oh don't do that Hawaiians don't do that somebody got hit with a well that's probably why it's pretty good weed yeah they got hit by a flying chunk of rock from the volcano on one of the boats too they were having lava tourism and someone getting clipped by a rock it's so not smart it's so stupid it's a dangerous dangerous situation shouldn't we don't go on those tools is your area safe my my area flooded a bit I had to replace my roads for about the 10th time in 10 years I always got to replace my roads I really got into making roads that's one thing that I really did enjoy yes I'll be headed back there and be making more Road so I'm excited about it I can cut a road like nobody's business joking I'm a hell of AI want to write a book my granny is a scout and because I do scout the jungle you know and make a road in there I love the attitude of people that live in a big island it's a very relaxed laid-back friendly attitude they just have all the time in the world it's a different sort of vibe when you go there yeah everybody helps their neighbors there they don't like turn them in yeah you know well everybody helps out their neighbors and their neighbors are like every every kind of people you can think of it's very very diverse cultural how'd you wind up back there well I went there because my son buck I had I made him go to the school out there so then I bought a place right by the school because this kid you know he had feel he's 23 now so he don't get mad but he had some severe ADHD there so I had to do what I did to get him now he just graduated from college he's doing real good yes yeah he's my first college grad mm-hmm all right ADHD maybe he's a comic yeah he's so funny oh my god he's so hilarious maybe is he's a comic just wait so sure it's all my grandkids are - they're all yeah video that you showed me yes they're all hilarious yeah they seem very funny what are they gonna do to your character on the show they're gonna kill you off yeah I think they did didn't I someone might know they didn't tell me how weird is this some of my spies told me how weird is it they're taking you out of Roseanne they're calling it the Connors it's all going on without you being there what does that feel like um it's a mind warp and a mind fuck you know so I'm just trying to call from a tweet yeah a misunderstood tweet I misunderstood tweet while you're on ambien why are you drunk deal I wasn't drunk only had like one or two beers well when you have one or two beers with ambient yeah I guess you're drunk you're fucked up I was yeah I wasn't in dance my wife a lot too right no I don't think I'd smoke pot down hmm no I didn't smoke pot down I was at my mom's house puffing on the cigs I went down in the basement I was hiding down there in the basement because they were surrounding my mom's house paparazzi's and such and says I down in the basement and that's where I always used to go when I was like 13 and I found this stuff and chalk on the on the walls of the basement there that I remembered right when I was 13 and then I found an old but from one I snuck cigs when I started smoking oh hell yeah it smoked good no but I was hiding down there smoking they were knocking on my mom's door and I was like oh my god so my boyfriend got the door he's like a big man you know he's like may I help you you know that's my man character and I thought they were gonna you know say something and they're like we just please tell Roseann we love her and you know we don't like this and blah blah and that was happening all the time and that's when I was like jeez I've never ever felt this kind of affection from people in all my career so it's kind of a cool that's that's the thing there's the social media outrage and then there's a people in real life that feel terrible for you because they feel like you got a raw deal yeah they think that there's Delta there there are so many double standards of people who said things on the air remember I just said it to a small population less than 600,000 people on Twitter but these people say things on the air and they are not well I know Joe I had to go pants and apologize so yeah what did Joy Behar say about pence it was so bad she something about his Christian faith yeah that they're psychotic or something because they so she called us yeah that's what I heard you know an apology with your network behind you really works like with what's-her-name that called Ivanka the names I can't no Samantha bee yeah and her network was behind her and that was far more offensive and it was on the air and but when your network is not behind you you don't really and they won't the thing about its they were they didn't want me to tweet the whole the whole truth is I I told him I wasn't going to tweet and you know I promised him over and over and although they never sent it in writing which was required but anyway they called my publicist and unloaded on him all the time and you know I should have stayed off Twitter I did it to myself and you know I made a mistake and and the ball kept rolling but it's just crazy that this what I think is an insignificant mistake especially in light of your apology could lead to no redemption possible yeah that no redemption possible that this giant fucking hit show and look I don't know what's gonna happen with the Conners but I think it's gonna fail if you asked me if I had some money to bet if I was in Vegas that shit ain't gonna work cuz you how are you gonna do Roseanne without Roseanne if you wanted to have a whole new sitcom with all those people with a totally unrelated storyline that's one thing but you don't think America's gonna know that they killed you off like what the fuck is that and that and now with time and consideration after time has passed and people can review everything they're gonna go was it really this bad and they're gonna think about their own lives like what about me what if I say something fucked up just fuck you shad dude I take ambien and accidentally say something crazy and don't even remember saying it and then it's misconstrued or it comes out wrong is that gonna ruin my whole life like how can you have someone ruin their whole life for something that is misconstrued mean also you know really I mean that's why I think first of all US women we needed to do a better job of raising our sons and but at 17 everyone's out of their friggin mind I have five kids there's not a one of them who didn't do something horrendous at age 17 well we were just talking about that with Andrew Santino who was in here earlier yeah when when young men especially young men that don't get a birds in the B speech and who knows what the fuck is going on in their home you know people do stupid shit my son that went to college but he says he learned the day he started college they gave out this pamphlet on sexual assault to all the boys I guess I gave it to the girls too but he said he read it and he realized it was any kind of sexuality at all his don't even do it and I told both my sons you gotta get if you're gonna have sex with somebody you make them sign a consent form and have take it to their lawyer and get it properly notarized and then make a date for after that happened even that's a dangerous time for our sons and our daughters well it's always a dangerous time for women right in if you really with the wrong man well or the wrong woman are you shittin me women are just as horrible as man until we're horrible with women to this one of those sexual assault and rape amongst lesbian couples it's it's pretty bad but I mean what about rape in the prisons nobody talks about that that's that's the real rape culture where men are learning you know it's terrible well yeah well we can get into depth about bad prisons are in general and how people aren't routine I watch that orange is the new black so I know I've never seen it it's great oh my god it's great but the problem with you know there's no rehabilitation it's it's very very similar goodness in prisons what you you're doing is you take people and you make them better criminals or make them more hardened criminals surround them with other criminals you give them a horrible work one further because most prisoners are in there cuz there are abuse children well and what percentage of prisoners are in there for nonviolent drug offenses really drives me crazy fuckin and so that's when I ran for president on legalization of marijuana for that exact reason well slowly but surely that's becoming a mainstream idea I'm glad I'm glad too I mean as a rabid pot user I love it now I think marijuana's it makes you more sensitive aware person it definitely makes you paranoid but I think that paranoia allows you to understand all the danger in the world that you're probably ignoring yeah you're like I was like I was with Marge you know once I started smoking pot then I got real paranoid of people and that was a good thing you should be paranoid of people you should be aware for sure continue you watch cable TV for crisis that ID channel what are you doing now like what are you gonna do now you were saying that you have some other things cooking you know I got twenty thousand ideas a day why don't you do something like that I gotta focus into something why don't you do this like something like this so easy I thought about it but you said you'd help me I just can't I don't know how to write in a fuckin password turn this shit on listen you don't need that we can get you to connected to someone who can do that for you that shit's easy I'd like to talk to other people who've fallen from grace and see how they get back up but the fuck the real truth of it is that there is redemption there is in there there's moving on and there's like stopping the fight and there's like you know for me it was all I realized they're not my family right my real family is you know a joy to me and sorry I got a great real family I raised two good sons and you know of course I want them protected from crazy women for crying out loud i io ver modulate their dating lives I do you do you filter them yeah you have to how old your sons once 40 when I was 40 try to filter my dating life I'd be like mom I love you yeah shut the fuck up well that's cuz your mom ain't me that's true cuz I go oh no this is you know we can't have no bitches up in here I can't I can't take no that second class bitch telling me I'm beneath her that's why I help break up my son's marriage because she why she treated me oh you had someone who's disrespecting you well I would never allow it no you're never gonna fucking well that she's never loved it and all my daughter's thank God all their sons they listen to me they do what I tell them so it's great so I have good son in laws well that's good the one no he's a problem he's from Russia he's Russian and on his wedding night here's what he says to me he goes um does he have a Russian accent yeah can you do it oh I can't do that I try well here's what he said to me knowing this family it's about it in this family we do what the purpose is we don't know what the grandmas cry ma says oh I go bitch are you new I go okay boy if you want to live a cursed life go ahead live a fucking curse I got voodoo on them yep I put that Jew do ya he's come around though I knew he would cuz I know they have a son and he has ADHD too and but he's brilliant and as all on my grandkids and anyway so they were there those lib tart oh I shouldn't have said that Luke tardes no you can't say them against it anymore no you're not to say that I forgot cuz I'm old I mix them up who says you not to say that everybody says you don't say the T word oh so long as you don't have a rebound for it I think you're allowed to say it no I don't say it in public but no I don't but uh anyway so um you know the kid he's bouncing off the walls to like all my kids were so I know how to deal with it you know right I said just leave him over here with me I'll take care of it so I did what you do with them let's get him active yeah you get him active get up do and stay exactly I go I bet you can I bet you $100 if you can't run up and down that hill ten times in a row ah perfect ha see ya got a kid boys tired yeah I guarantee I have ADHD I have all those things yeah you probably do just do stuff just burn this stuff yeah brine it out and then you can become yeah yeah luckily I think those kids just have a lot of fuel I do they have a lot of horsepower and a lot of fuel and it's all misdirected yeah cuz they getting with the girl and she start telling them what to do see I'm telling you once they get under the control of a female say they're they forget their selves yeah girls do it too sure they're getting the control the wrong guy yeah you got to not get in control and Noble anybody right does the key autonomy and what do they call it sovereignty you gonna keep that find somebody who doesn't control you right just accepts you let you be yeah don't make your shower yeah no they have to make them shower oh boy you should at least suggest it yeah in a nice way yeah I should let him know yeah fuck is going on with your smell son yeah I come from weird line of women that like that man smell it was gross my mom she used to always go over and sniff under my dad's armpits it was so gross don't wonder I'm like I am mmm you know so when you were Oh Tarzan oh she likes monkey smell don't say that word monkey yeah white guy it's alright oh he called white people wanting my dad was real dark how dark he was brown brown yeah well maybe it'd be problematic oh yeah she was ruled their mom so I've learned a thing or two Joel I hear you but to me all people look like some kind I mean I didn't say anything about Valerie Jarrett but on the subject I think people resemble animals a lot well we are animals oh yeah we are animals yeah like I think I look like a beaver when I look at my pictures dude no he look like a beaver or a cat more of your time yeah I could see myself as a cat I think that never my kids think I'm real cat like yes yeah my boyfriend says sloth cuz I just lay there in bed watching the ID channel on murders and sex oh my god cuz I love how this character is put together you know writing characters mm-hmm you know you just look I like the forensics thing right when they put shit together you know and they go the are our perp is a our purpose of 40 year old white man lives with his mother and he's probably it was in the Navy you know all that said right I love all that I would have done that if I wasn't a comic genius I think the real prize a problem with that though is that the more you study that shit the more you live in that world the less happiness you're gonna find I've talked to guys that what world the world of serial killers the woman study in it yeah the actual people that investigate those people oh yeah they have a real hard time with life they have a real hard time because they know too much they know too much about the did you watch that show mind hunter didn't watch that one oh that's about John Douglas yeah I've seen so many of those shows I've read books on serial killers I you know and I've known cops that investigated stuff like this well after I had that thing with Marge I got really into it like oh my god well you realize there's some people out there that are they have a dark mind yeah they're capable of some fucked up shit yeah they are and if you're around that all the time I just think your appreciation for it's like it's one thing to know that it exists and it's a real but it's another thing to let that enter into your yeah your view of the world and how in there is a standard standard kind of behavior I guess it's wrong to do that but you know nothing else interests me who why is it interesting to you so much just because it's such like how they get away with it and they're like oh he was a nicest guy I mean how they their front you know the Golden State killer right you know that was a just us together that was it what he was called the Golden State yeah that fucking guy got away with it forever Patton Oswalt's wife who died of a drug overdose was actually investigating that she died of a drug I thought she died from fentanyl Oh everyone's dying from that ran from that shit everywhere I mean where can I get some it must be good if that's the connors to try to get you I don't know what you're gonna do I don't want to say nothing negative be back you'll be like you could be like from beyond the grave you could give advice to people on the show that'd be a great way they can kill you off and bring you back the same type of ghost yeah a ghost you come to John Goodman the middle of the night what the fuck are you talking about yeah you think they can come up with something better than just killing you off yeah they just letting it go well I think I mean they do have these movies about robots and other war they don't want to be connected with a racist i know you're not a racist and that's what's so fuckin stupid about this they had a number-one show a great sitcom it returns it's even better than it was when i think you know i think it was a bit better - it was great thank you well you know that was all I was meant to do so you know I did it I did it number one after 20 years and what about doing stand-up again I'm doing stand-up on Couture next year yeah bitches I'm really yeah and by then my gag or it'll be over sorts can you talk about the gag order or is that a part of the gag order it's yeah I wish everybody I just want to say I wish everybody the best you know I wish well for everyone on earth that's all I'm going to say what are you gonna do stand them next year 2019 where you gonna do it yeah I can't remember what they said it's in the Midwest all across the Midwest are you writing already are you performing at all I mean are you I'm right you're just writing yeah and how you gonna do it are you gonna start out at clubs are you gonna do theaters casinos do you have a framework of what you're gonna talk about yeah then talk about raising good sons and all that that entails are you gonna bring someone with you on the road to warm up or I probably should I don't know I was kind of saying I wanted to co-headline to I thought a coat headline with Monique would be a blast that's a great idea yeah me and her talked about it that'd be fun yeah I mean anybody just yeah just a good out there again tell my jokes I really like hearing people out there'd be a great thing for you too yeah I'm doing stand-up oh I did it just before you know in fact I think that's why I got so run down you know I got so run down when I you know this whole thing I was so run down at that point that I had no b-vitamins in my body how's it impossible well I mean it was a really low love mmm and the doctor said you know that can cause psychosis so that's where I go okay that's what happened to me really I was at weight I was getting way out there in Salt Lake City Utah anyway after I did do stand-up all through Canada and then I ended up in New York doing promo for Roseanne and I just got to run down I didn't I didn't watch myself and do what I should have done for my physical health well this this time around let's get you sorted out let's get you on some vitamins and okay get you a nutritionist and get somebody who's gonna you know do some blood work on you and make sure everything's okay blood work done I always go I go to the Cancer Center at whatever that Hospital is called over there yeah that's good I always have to have been fusions every three months cuz I I don't absorb minerals more vitamins what do you mean you don't absorb them yeah I had this gastric bypass about 25 so years ago and I can't absorb minerals or vitamins and so I have to go get infusions every you know when I get to down and I like I said I was promoting the Roseanne show and also doing some touring in Canada and I got to run down and I I just I I think I had a mental collapse I told the network I said obviously I'm not behaving in the right way and I will check myself in and get my meds check to make sure I'm you know you know so I said I have mental health issues and you know I I said also I thought that woman was white and it wasn't anything about race it was about Iran and it was like well we'll see how this washes out that's what is very Sherman yeah we'll see how this washes out because the scene minutes later Wanda Sykes tweeted let me off this show and then Sara Gilbert tweeted shortly thereafter something about she was ashamed of one cast member and what that one blew me away Anna and Michael fisherman tweeted he was ashamed of my racism or some shit and that was hard to take but it's because it was so it seemed orchestrated because they used the same words you know egregious unforgivable but in fact it might have been offensive and like when I was talking to Mike today I said you know we all say things they're racially insensitive at times all of us do that I'm a Jew I've heard everything and you know it or ethnically offensive to somebody but that doesn't mean we're the KKK okay that doesn't mean we're you know fascists or you know and especially if we apologize because most people who are offensive they mean to be offensive and they don't apologize and I think that's when you know there's a difference and if you don't have the discretion to understand that something's wrong with you and I think something's wrong with people that they're so hateful and so unforgiving and if you don't vote the way they think you should vote that they feel justified in being so what's the words so sanctimonious and self-righteous and when they themselves are you know kind of saying far more offensive things about people's children and such for instance I think people are just cowards and I think when things like this happen they want to separate themselves from controversy and make sure they're not a part of the package I can understand this I can kind of understand it but I don't get it that's what they do you know and you know I'm like wow they also get really really upset when a few years later somebody does the exact same thing to them got what goes around comes around and that's true and especially true in Hollywood the guy that fired me just was fired a couple weeks ago for what I don't know his contract wasn't renewed mmm in his last words were well I didn't know I'd be forced to cancel our number one show he wasn't forced to do anything well he might have been forced they're all fools they should just first of all they should have let the dust settle second of all they should have examined what you actually said and what your intentions were and let you apologize yeah and then have a conversation with you on one of their shows in long form you mean a teaching moment such as if Valerie Jarrett would have accepted that yeah I said I would like to debate her on the Iran deal and explain what I would said well you know that's not necessary I mean what Americans should know about that deal well maybe they should but I don't think that's completely related to your tweet but it would have been a teachable moment maybe but it also would have been a distraction from what you were trying to say well they didn't let me say it right and you know but to get involved like openly politically I know that's dangerous but Taylor Swift just did it what did she say just say get out and vote for the Democrat yeah but though it wasn't that like it's almost abstract get out and vote you know no she said vote for the Democrat I don't like the Republican Marsha Blackburn she didn't like her although Marsha Blackburn has been the author of a lot of great anti rape laws and all kinds of stuff like that but she didn't like her because she's a Republican so she took a stand a political stand I guess you know some people can do it yeah but some people can't and the political stand I took which I just want to remind people is that I'm I'm an independent that's my stance and I just thought both sides had gone too far out and needed to talk to each other so I came back and did a show about that that sustains you took with your show yeah and in my life it's like if we can't even discuss things that's really really bad but that's not American we we discuss and debate we don't label and blacklist we certainly can talk things and maybe that's something that you could have done once they had a conversation with you about your tweet but I mean I just think that what they did was just very hasty and very foolhardy and they should have known who you were beforehand they should have known about your mental health issues they should know they should have known about your medication issues you know those things they knew but this is what my point was if you have a person with a broken leg and they can't run and you get mad at them because they can't run that isn't that ridiculous well if you have a person that has brain issues and then they do something that's erratic and you're mad at them for that well you're a fucking idiot that's stupid and you call them a racist or chastised them in front of the world so that you remove any possible any possible negative opinions that could be cast your way I mean that's what a lot of it is it's deflection they're worried about negative opinions and negative feedback that's going to come their way so they immediately turn on you they turn on you in a disproportionate way well they did cancel the show before even one advertiser had pulled out it reminds me Sarah Silverman's bit I'm for against it remember that I'm for against it yeah well there's a lot of cowardice going on there's a lot of people trying to save their jobs and people panic because people are aware of the outrage culture that we live in this is an outrage nation right now it's it's one of our number one forms of recreation people love it they love getting mad at whoever the fuck it is as long as you react the way they want you to react oh they love it it's an inquisition well it's it's the understanding that people have way more power to affect change whether it's good change or bad change they're pushing buttons with social media and with outrage and with their ability to express themselves it's unprecedented there's never been a time like this in history no we're people well Salem witch trials yeah I mean it's like okay well if you swim that proves you're a witch and then we have to drown you there's no it's no it has so there has to be a loser because there can't be two winners well there has to be an understanding of what's happening here and then people have to have an understanding of the power that they're wielding and what they're doing and that it could turn back on them as well it doesn't ever just stop at one person that's why I said I'm surprised that a lot more comics didn't defend me because you know this means that anything they find in your timeline that they think is offensive they can mischaracterize and bring a whole battle against you that you can't possibly win and take your life's work well how many did defend you  nobody defended me well I did you did thank you and hope did Stanhope did yeah there was a mountain that we're working we know none of them that worked with you well everybody that works you wanted to keep their job yeah and I don't blame him I don't blame him they probably you know needed the money and probably already spent it well the other thing to the sitcom life that that fucking schedule is ruthless it's cool but you know what I think it was a lot of it was you know I gave him the gun to shoot me I mean yes yeah I wasn't a helpless victim although I think my explanation you either make sense or doesn't make sense but well if you're compassionate it makes sense yeah but uh a lot of people aren't but um you know I forgot what I was I don't even know if they're not compassionate Rosanna I think they're scared I think they're just chicken shit I don't think they're looking at it from in terms of like I can't win here and I can't lose here let me just look at what's right see I didn't have anything to win or lose so what I looked at it I looked at you as someone that I admire sometimes I think is one of the best comics ever who I think I know that you have mental health issues I knew from talking to you that you were on ambien and I knew you had alcohol as well I know what that does my mom took ambien she woke up in the middle the night and drew all over the bathroom rug drew all over it with lipstick and and and and nail polish she said like a little kid said she woke up in the morning she had no idea she did it she's terrified of that shit she won't take it now yeah I have my friends many friends that have had bad experiences on ambien I have too and I thought well they shouldn't have shut down that conversation like that they shouldn't have it's a fucking dangerous drug too for the wrong people in the wrong situations especially when you mix it with alcohol I mean it's beneficial to people that need sleep in certain situations I don't recommend it I don't take it but some people like it that's fine but to ignore what the actual pharmacological effect on the human body is is ridiculous because they're Studies on this shit and that people understand the interaction between chemicals and the human brain and they're erratic and especially when you mix them with things you're not supposed to mix them with weird should happen yeah I love that tweet I thought it was gonna I thought I was gonna expand on it in the morning and you know talk about that movie and too late yeah yeah it was too late but the whole thing is just fucking crazy when well they told me not to tweet yeah well it's probably a good idea but now honestly the problem also with Twitter's fucking text is just to it's too simple yeah it's too crude a way of communicating it really is you can get across some ideas like you can say hey I went to see littlefoot's a great movie that's a good thing to tweet yeah real simple shit like that well I want to talk about like political things or things that involve nuance or seeing things that are complex I just don't think it's the way to communicate I don't either anymore no that's a terrible way to communicate yeah you know it's not communicate it's like what did he say Search and Destroy eat well for some folks yeah people there's gonna be people that always want to make things crash and burn they like it they like hitting the buttons they like to see people suffer well they definitely are suffering themselves look there's a giant percentage of our population that lives in misery I know it they do all day long and they they have mental health issues they're exhausted they're depressed they're there they have despair they're overwhelmed with bills they're in shitty relationships they're overwhelmed and they're angry and they look at someone like you a rich white lady and like fuck that bitch and they just want to attack you and it doesn't have to make sense because it's a reflection of their own personal pain as much as it's a reflection of their irresponsibility with this power that they're wielding through social media and then there's the mob mentality there's a bunch of people that are already going after you good I'm gonna go after two I'm gonna show the world that I'm not racist you know how I'm gonna do that I'm gonna shit all over this racist this racist Roseanne they don't care if you're really racist but the thing that gets me about it is this I'm gonna shit all over this Jew because I was talking about Iran as a Jew and speaking about Persian Jews and you know all kinds of Arabs we're talking about complexity it is complex but I always was on there talking you know defending or you know speaking for Jewish people and so you know I just I think that in the long run I really want it to be known that I am a Jew and was speaking as a Jew and when I spoke about the Iran deal and its effect on Jewish people in the Middle East and I really thought first they didn't know that but now I think well they had to know some of it I don't think they want to know this is what I think you say someone says that's a black woman even what is she 1/8 black like what is she something very small 46% or something really yeah she had her DNA done was talking about it oh and 40-something Caucasian and it doesn't look like but whatever whatever yeah we can't tell who people are by how they look I'm 1.6 percent African cool awesome that's the heart of the world when you look at what happened I think it's real simple I think she identifies or people identify her as a black woman you said Planet of the Apes racist yeah it's that simple I don't think they give a fuck of you're a Jew I don't think they care yeah not racist I think this is a viable target yeah well I said I voted for Trump so I was a target to that too and then and then they could find out a tweet from the past but let's not let's not forget either oh yeah I got in trouble for though don't many times yeah you know you just things you can't say and then there's worse things that you can so it's weird cuz they don't censor anybody who's you know calling for you know to kill all the Jews there are thousands of them let me check about they're not famous women with sitcoms yeah they are who you know people that are are tweeting support for Valerie Jarrett who you know are pissed at me and saying how could you say this about they're not saying that because they're saying kill the Jews they don't they don't maybe know what your point was well then I didn't know like I didn't know about her parentage I mean come on this is this is the truth this is who I am and you know they they they did this but they're not really saying kill the Jews it's not like a valid comparison well I'm a Jew I understand that but the people that's how it feels maybe it feels that way it does but the people are number oh boss they're upset at you because they think you said something racist I know you're not saying kill the Jews well but they are to us okay you see how when people look at your situation I can see how they think but but you see how when people look at your situation and they think it's racist uh-huh that is also how you look at they're reacting to what they think is racist and you thinking that they're saying kill all the Jews well they're saying like you know Iran every day threatens the Jewish people in Israel with annihilation and they've already survived you know not too long ago an annihilation so and then we make a deal with that government what does that does say something I understand that this is many steps past but to me I thing that you said a racist thing or thinking you said a racist and I understand that they think I said a racist thing yeah I understand that completely they have no idea that this had anything to do with Jews versus Iran they really don't have any idea the I've never seen that I've never seen that Ridge because it's not important enough to them to know that well it's probably not been explained to them yeah for one I know your position like this like you're talking about now I understand why they might not even think it's valid like if they went back and went over it you might disagree with the political aspects of it yes and they're free to do that I'm not gonna try to internalize but you know I'm saying like they're not the reason why I said it's not a valid comparison they're not really saying kill the Jews but to me and to other Jews they are in fact saying that and and that's very common amongst us so you know that's that's the truth that many of us think and you know people don't understand it or they don't you know care to even consider it well they don't have to but I'm still going to say it because it's the reality it's the reality to hear that and to hear that United States went and gave them billions of our tax dollars when they're the number-one supporter of terror in the world it is and they always do kill Jews like in Paris and wherever else they go did they do it in London too I mean you know I hate to wake people up but you know it is important at least it is to me and to people like me and to many other people many Christians it's very important to them to they're under onslaught - I'm not exactly sure what you're talking about because you're talking about Iranians killing people in Paris in England I'm talking about being the number-one sponsor of terror in the world Iran but they're killing people in France and England yeah that are Jews when when is this happening well when they that theater and a lot of other times but there's a lot of Baby Bottle Jewish women to death in her in her Paris apartment there's a lot of it I'm not saying they only kill Jews but they do kill Jews okay and the money goes back to those terrorist organizations that are funded by Qatar and Iran this is a there's a pretty these are general things you're saying yeah it's very general and there's a hundred shades there's a hundred shades but I'm just saying as a Jew with a family in Israel this is what we think and that this is how we feel and to not even acknowledge that in any discussion and it's kind of disturbing actually factored in I don't think it's a matter of not acknowledging it I think it should be factored in I think they're aware that this had anything to do with your motivation well it's not expressed I've never read it anywhere what's that you can't say it that's what I'm saying it can't say it yeah it's not really smiled on to go against the people who control our media and say especially social media and say that you're pro-israel or you know that you think  you don't think that the media will allow you to be pro-israel I mean that seems like a really common thing not on social media for the most part no it's very anti-israel y'all I'll send you statistics well I see some anti-israel sentiment and especially in relation to a they treat the Palestinians like I see a lot of that yeah well I'm not gonna play into either of those because I I really believe that you know there's a solution to that problem the solution is peace and I think it can be achieved so I'm not gonna play either one of those games about who does this or what I just like to see a solution that works for all the people they're all people there so but it can't be yeah but it can't be if one side has been completely censored and it that isn't a discussion nor is it a debate and nor is it American scary it's scary times when you know like on our college campuses today I know this because my son was on one and you know it's a far left there far left professors that expose that kind of stuff daily in all of our colleges and it does find its way to the media you look at the media that most what are they called millennium Millennials consume and it's heavily to the left it is yeah and so that's where they're forming there they are getting their opinions from only hearing one side of things on social media and I don't think that's good well I don't think it's good that all conservative voices are being censored off Twitter you know and well not all I shouldn't say all but that so many are because that's a way to shut down discussion too there's quite a few conservative voices on Twitter but some are when they might think they're inflammatory or they think they're espousing hate yeah right you're deciding that it right it's people who are heavily political yes yes that's not right it should ease lean right all of them it should be more in the middle where both sides are considered to come to that's what consensus means is a diverse opinion and that's how you reach consensus you don't get a consensus nor a solution from only listening to one side blather on the same shit for 20 years well not only that keeps people fighting out each other not only does it keep people fighting I think it recruits people for the other side I think it does the opposite of its intended effect that's what one of my friend said he said he thinks Michael Moore that's Michael Moore's role since he's a billionaire - that he's a billionaire well they said this what they said I don't know but it's a in that vein it's like well he did get so many people to vote for Trump when he said that stuff about people are angry and they I don't think he did it on purpose I think he's just there's a lot of people credit him for voting for Trump for that speech yeah well I'm sure so my friend said maybe he's a double agent which I don't think you know I think this is one of the things that happens when it's like when when you give people that much suppression and you you try to indoctrinate people into thinking a certain way there's gonna be people that resist it a larger I hope so and it seems larger and larger but freedom of thought is the basis of this country it's not freedom of speech or freedom of religion and freedom of expression the Second Amendment those are symptoms of freedom of thought yeah and it's good to consume endless propaganda and and never have it broken down or or debated or pointed out that it's false there is an issue when you're only getting one side of the argument and the people that are controlling the media only want that one side expressed that is a problem yeah and the notion to that right now swing version of it well cuz they won't let it happen who's that you know the people that are in charge of program in the networks they don't want that team toe seemed to always lean left I mean technologically oriented companies yeah in corporations always almost invariably lean left why do you think that is they're smart they're educated they're fresh out of college the colleges are indoctrinating left-wing kids yeah you know you have a vast majority of professors at universities all across the country that identify as Democrats right so this is the indoctrination they get from people that they respect deeply and that they're learning from there's also an understanding that this is the way you advance you know and then when someone comes out that has anything wait a minute you said you didn't think that it has a brain Center you just think it was coordinated it's not coordinated in terms of the government I think what's happening in the universities is you've got people that are first of all they're existing in this bizarre glass walled garden where they they go to universities they're getting doctrine into these left-wing cultures and then they start teaching at universities and they never get out into the real world and then they teach children these thoughts and ideas and then most of the kids leave and they take these ideas somewhere else and then slowly over time they become more moderate most of them do or they they reject those ideas and either go to the center or go right or some of them stay left yeah but when they go into tech does Moscow Center a lot of unko Center which is I think probably where sanity is I think and I think discussion is critical I have a lot of friends at a Republican I have a lot of friends that are liberal there's nothing wrong with either maybe their mindset and the only way we find out whether or not we really agree or disagree is we let people express themselves right and as soon as you suppress that kind of expression then you run into real problems that's absolutely right and that's what I wanted on my show is that there that I would show that there was a a Trump lover and a Trump hater in the same house and they managed to deal with it and get on that's a great that's a great premise for a show and it was one of the reasons why I think people loved it so much is because there was that conflict and because look people can love a lovable curmudgeon people can love someone who has ideas that they disagree with people can love someone who lives with someone who has a completely opposing opinion they figure it out and they get along that's fine that's great that's all I thought it was great and my boyfriend said my boyfriend said your mistake is that you put a cramp in the hate business I don't think that's the case I think that just you you you became a target if I don't think they were happy from the beginning they I don't think they really wanted me to come back I think there's a certain amount of that when they found out that you're a trump supporter and then the show became successful and Donald Trump loved it and then they thought I was a troublemaker in a big mouth they've always thought that well you're a comic I know and everybody remembers when you sing the national anthem and grabbed your crotch and spit on the ground I don't remember that when you do that gastric bypass thing is that something they can reverse they could reverse it but what the hell then alway 800 would you really don't know a large Marv you wouldn't yeah I would would ya oh fuck yeah that's how I had it cuz I couldn't stop talk about addiction impulsive right oh yeah all day long eclairs what have you i whatever you loved it yeah it was great I hate those goddamn things eclairs no got gastric bypass surgeries people yeah they do but I just wish there was a better way it's just because it fuck's up your nutrient absorption abilities yeah yeah I mean I've heard that from several people I know guys have gotten in that's your mental state yeah I'm sure oh for sure a lot of it has to do with the the the health of your you know your your body your your ability to absorb nutrients affects everything your mood your yeah your energy levels everything you mean food doesn't get in there the right way no I just lay in bed till they called for me you know man I'd like to stumble and do my thing go back to bed I just had no energy listen bro Sam why don't you do something like this what like this oh this conversation was - you could do this on your time whenever you want to do it yeah without anybody telling you what to say or what not to say without any executives without anybody to fire you won't they ud you to be or something I mean they kick you off everything they could but I don't think they would and on top of that you could do it off of your own website you could do it on Roseanne Barr calm yeah yeah I'm always afraid they'll come you know I'm part I I just feel like hey this the time my life from 66 it's probably time for me to just lay low do stand-up sometimes that's a great idea you know that's even better yeah go do that then and show us some of my farming videos yeah but some people like to know about how to grow food and I'm really good at growing food when you do stand-up and you go on a tour I think it's gonna be hugely successful thank you I really do I think people gonna come out in droves I think it's gonna be awesome and I think once you get your legs on to you you start doing a few shows and get things cracking again you'll be like the Roseann of all you'll be crushing it I was crushing it I have to say in my tour of Canada I was crushing my shoe and one blast I had oh my god I just had the most fun you know ninety minutes of beautiful control over you know Bing Bing Bing and I've got like a big life every 90 seconds and beautiful you know I tailor and craft it and love it love the people that come out to see me good diverse crowd - which is great well I bet it'll be even more diverse now well it's gonna be way better I think cuz I'm gonna really start talking about the real me such as my abhorrence and fear of serpents scared of serpents oh yeah I always have been don't go to Florida no I won't don't go to the swamps for sure you heard about what's going on down there what with people releasing pythons oh no over decades you didn't know no oh Florida's overrun with pythons oh my god non-native pythons cuz people release them as pets and then they moved to the swamps and bred yeah they've eaten everything there's almost no mammals in the swamps oh my god I said 99% of all raccoons are gone we couldn't find any Marsh rabbits they couldn't find any Bobcats and the the pythons have started eating alligators o of them out there say the world's gone nuts raising stay away from Florida I will I had a I had a turtle that kind of felt are we done no I mean we can be done help or you can keep going well I had this turtle that fell in love with me one to me with me in Hawaii I was so weird now this is for true I've either been really afraid of serpents okay so uh so I go in the ocean there and my friends they're like don't touch the turtles there's a five thousand dollar fine of something you don't touch yes he feels big old thing yeah sound like you know like I say I'm a Jew so since I hear that I'm like yeah well fuck them I'm touching it you know so I did and then it turned it when and start swimming around me and then it went in this big circle and its head came out of the water and it's I died me and I was like oh Christ it's the serpent I've been afraid of my whole life and he chased me on to the shore she goes that's why we don't touch the turtles because they bond with you whoa like this guy wants me to marry him with you yeah if you touch him they like you they're like hey she'll go for it it was a terrifying I've seen them in the water they're fucking cool to look at they're swimming they're awesome they're like a little Volkswagen with these four paddles not a serpent head coming out and like this they look so did they go side eye I'll know now mmm it was terrible something to think of terrifying yeah I've never gone back in that water well yeah I could see where that would be a problem and I have a lot of serpent things and also like when I see people I can see if they were serpent or not you know how they say the reptilian like I told my kids is the hardest thing like that David Icke type shit well I really do see him know I sort of believe him he's gone down a rabbit hole that guy oh it's more like a like a gopher hole some were real deep into the core of the earth but I think he talks about that stuff anymore no he kind of laid it back but that's as I confronted him did you just lost it yeah well that's what I was doing on Twitter to his DM and people going you've lost it it was fun like I did it so I used to do these uh fake phone or crank phone calls before they got that star-69 and I was married what's-his-face then the oaf and he came in the room there and he told me stop doing it and he looked at my address book and I was I was calling general Schwarzkopf to do it to him and he's like you don't crank call generals work cuz I had all these numbers anyway so was I saying yeah you said yeah but then I went to the DM you know on that's the way get like people like just getting riled up that way well just go come on you're losing it yeah what did David Icke say he said they're like all the big major world figures really secretly reptilians yeah reptilians shapeshifters yeah and I told my kids here's how I told my kids just the hardest thing I'll ever tell you but and I didn't know so I couldn't help it at the time but I recently found out that your dad is reptilian but sort of a joke but they are half reptilian but I can see like people becoming the reptile like I'll see them and their head goes up like this you know like on TV their head their neck goes out like this and then the tongue comes out of the corner to let go out like that they do it I see it on TV all the time mm-hmm I see the cause of reptile all them devil worshipers like who do you go to those devil worship parties here they're talking about in

340,"[Music] the Fifth Estate good evening I'm Eric Malley nine Canadians who were the unwitting victims of CIA brainwashing experiments are suing the United States government but so far the Canadian government has done nothing to help them if I were in charge of the government to whom nine citizens that we are suing for have been brainwashed without their knowing have had their lives impaired and have it done by a foreign agency undercover without the Government of Canada knowing it I would find a way to help those people instead of hindering them four years ago there was some startling revelations about the activities of the CIA in Canada the American intelligence agency had paid for a series of brainwashing experiments under a project codenamed MK ULTRA the tests were conducted in secret in the United States and in Canada at a mental hospital attached to McGill University experimental drugs including LSD were administered to human guinea pigs the patients were never told that their treatment was part of a CIA experiment nine Canadians are now suing the US government for a million dollars apiece they charged that their lives were disrupted forever as a result of the brainwashing despite the fact that the CIA operated secretly in Canada to fund these medical experiments on Canadian citizens the federal government in Ottawa has joined hands with the government in Washington to hold back vital information which might at last reveal all the sordid details in Winnipeg Val Orlick au spends a lot of time tending her plants it's one of the few hobbies she has left she used to devour books and write long letters now she can't concentrate on a book for more than a single page and writing a letter is beyond her she's on medication 24 hours a day if she wasn't married to David Orlick Oh an NDP Member of Parliament she might never have learned the full story of what happened to her in 1956 suffering from depression after childbirth mrs. Orlick Co was referred by her Winnipeg doctor to a top psychiatrist in Montreal unknowingly she was about to become part of a cruel CIA experiment codenamed MK ULTRA in Langley Virginia outside of Washington stands the headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency protected by walls of secrecy as high as the trees stored inside computers like this one is what's left of the CIA files on the MKULTRA project convinced the Soviets and Chinese had perfected brainwashing during the Korean War the agency sought to perfect its own techniques both to protect its agents and to use as a weapon who did you meet with in the safehouse the CIA man overseeing the project was John Gibbon jur there was continued pressure put upon anybody within the agency in connection with trying to explain or understand brainwashing so we were charged with rather elaborate attempt to try to find out chemical psychological any kind of means that people could use to influence the behavior of the people in Montreal on the side of the mountain overlooking the city stands an ancestral home bearing a name worthy of an Edgar Allan Poe horror tale Ravens cracked donated to McGill Ravens Craig became the Allen Memorial Institute for the treatment of mental illness here the CIA channeled money for MKULTRA sub-project 68 which became a real-life horror tale the project chief in Montreal was dr. Ewen Cameron world-renowned chairman of the department of psychiatry at McGill and director of the Allen memorial Institute the CIA secretly funded the medical experiments through a front in New York City called of all things the Society for the protection of human ecology documents show that the agency had been impressed with earlier work done at McGill in sensory deprivation work that was useful in designing sophisticated torture techniques later on but at the time brainwashing looked even more promising and dr. Cameron was the perfect one to carry out the work an American citizen with a world-class reputation operating outside of the United States dr. Cameron certainly had the credentials at various times president of the Canadian the American and even the world psychiatric association in an address to colleagues from around the world Cameron showed that he certainly knew the potential of the human mind for good and bad though all echo came to the Allan for her postpartum depression everybody in the hospital was very much in awe of dr. Cameron and he strode the halls like a giant and people would say oh they're but for God goes God and to me I thought how could he possibly ever take me for a patient Who am I I'm being this great man who's done all these marvelous things and boy I better work hard and I better do everything that he tells me to do and you know I don't want to lose this opportunity to get well like mrs. Orlick Oh mrs. Janine Huard of Montreal came to dr. Cameron depressed after childbirth the depression was made worse by a hearing problem that coincided with the birth of her child she too was in awe of dr. Cameron it was a very very impressive man and I was told it was the best doctor in averag North America I saw him he would look at you a few minutes ask you a few questions and then proceed with the treatments but I never saw him once in all the times that I saw him that I wasn't afraid every time I went down to his office I would shake with fear and every time I'd see him coming down the hall I'd shake with fear but I adored him dr. Elliott Emmanuel knew Cameron he was an authoritarian ruthless power-hungry nervous tense angry man not really nice at Raven's Cregg dr. Cameron went further with drugs and electric shock treatments than any of the US researchers in the MKULTRA project dared his aim was to wipe the mind clean then he would implant new messages by forcing the patient to listen to a hypnotic repetition as many as a quarter of a million times this was called psychic driving most of the drugs used in the program were experimental and some dangerous there was the tranquilizer Arte a paralysis inducing and neck tee and curare which pygmies tip their arrows with to paralyze victims Alba captain another experimental tranquilizer and lysergic acid diethylamide the Hallucigenia a in her room at Raven's Craig misses Orlick Oh waited for her first treatment hypodermic with a needle syringe and the card on it had my name so I looked a little more closely and it was lysergic acid diethylamide and my husband was a druggist and I knew a lot of drugs but I'd never heard of that one and so I phoned a friend and who was a psychiatric nurse and I said do you know what it is and she said I never heard of it but she had a friend who was a psychiatrist so she phoned her friend and she called me back and she said he said that this stuff causes poisonous psychosis she said he just said not to take it well I thought you know he's a very Freudian psychiatrist and doesn't believe in any medication of any kind and after all here's dr. Cameron I mean he's the big doctor and he's you know he's known all over the world and he wouldn't do anything that would harm me etc and so I took the injection and I didn't like it and it really did create a poisonous psychosis LSD with all its frightening mental images was scarcely known at the time but the CIA secretly brought some in from Switzerland where it had just been developed the room became very distorted and I thought my bones were all melting and I just wanted to scream that I wanted to get out of there and I saw the squirrels outside and I thought they're not the squirrels I'm the squirrel I'm in this cage and I can't get out and I started to throw myself from side to side in the room and I couldn't right they had given me a pen some paper and asked me to write down but I couldn't write I couldn't do anything I couldn't focus I couldn't I don't know it was like some kind of funny hail I'd fallen into and I couldn't get out and I don't know how long that went on it was just a terrible nightmare and I just felt that my life was threatened I could never go back to what I'd been Robert loggia Vancouver was 18 when he came to the Allen complaining of trembling and severe leg pains diagnosed as psychosomatic like mrs. Orlick oh and mrs. who are he had no inkling he was to be part of a CIA experiment LSD was very horrifying and they gave it to me for about 12 or 15 times one minute I would see the doctor there and explained I wouldn't see him there and they were asking me all kinds of questions and I remember them telling me that I was getting smaller and smaller and I really felt myself getting smaller and they were bringing me back in time way back and you know at one point I almost felt like it was just about to be born really that far back in memory and they're really really probing and asking all kinds of questions and I felt I didn't have any control I had to answer I didn't feel I had any control I was completely like they had complete control over me mrs. Hugh art like the others was forced to pay for the so-called treatment massive electric shocks and all the drugs they would give me as much as 40 pills a day and I would ask the nurse what is that they would say it's a new drug and they only named it by a number almost drugs do to you how did they know I was I was very very strong well powered so these drugs kind of desensitize me they would put my my reactions they would lower my resistance as well as the experimental drugs and massive electric shock treatments missus who art was subjected to psychic driving hypnotic like messages were repeated over and over to a sleeping patient sometimes for as long as 16 hours in a row they were a key part of the mind-control experiment this is how missus who art remembers one of the messages I would try very strongly not to be not to let my mind be capting all the messages but they would lower my resistance so much with the average rugs but I could I couldn't do otherwise then listen did you ever ask them how any of this was making you better no I didn't ask question I was just saying I don't want to go through it again and I would cry I didn't want you know I knew you way down in my heart I knew it wasn't good but you know how could you fight you're in a hospital where it's supposed to be the best with the best doctors so what can you do I'd say I can't I can't take it anymore I can't stand it I don't think this is doing me any good I feel worse and he'd walked down the hall a little way with me and put his arm on my shoulder and come on now lassie you know you're going to do it and finally I'd say well okay and off we'd go to my room and he would give me another injection and then pat me on the shoulder and off he'd be again I had LSD I believe a total of 14 times and sometimes there would be four days between the injections and sometimes there would be one consecutive day after the other and some of them I managed to write down things in my notes to talk to Cameron a newly declassified CIA document shows there was at least one voice of protest at the agency as the experiments got underway one agent wrote does Project Officer approve these immoral and inhuman tests I suggest that all who are in favor of the above intended operation volunteered their heads for use in dr. so-and-so's noble project the names were deleted in her hospital room a terrified mrs. Allah Co tried to hide like a child at the sound of dr. Cameron's approaching footsteps sit on the toilet and nobody will see me anyhow that didn't work because he knocked on the door and he said now come on Lassie you know you're in there and come on you come out and let me give your injection and I said no I'm not taking any more injections I can't do it I don't care if I die I can't I can't do it anymore because this is killing me and that's all there is to it I can't do it well he wasn't very happy about it and however after a little discussion he turned on his heel and left the room the electric shock treatments were administered on an unprecedented scale it was called deep patterning the mind was short-circuited so the psychic driving hypnotic messages could be planted on a clean slate there is now no known use of electric shocks on such a scale even in Soviet mental asylums where political crimes are punished psychiatrist and former colleague of dr. Cameron dr. Elliot Emmanuel as you probably know electroshock treatment has been given for depression for something like 40 years now it's a very successful and useful treatment for severe depression that doesn't respond to other things but deep patterning is a use of electroshock treatment in totally different way in which instead of giving the shocks say two or three times a week they're given two or three times a day for three or four weeks reducing the patient to a sort of animal vegetable state from which it's hoped that they would recover in a more healthy state of mind it didn't work I was there for a while I thought I don't want to stay here started to run away from the hospital and they grabbed me and then they put me on sleep treatment and now they kept you asleep for 23 days and while I was asleep they were shocking the heck out of me with electric shocks and playing tapes there was another lady who had same kind of psychic driving that I did and she was a very wiry slender lady and with lots of pep and zip you know and she'd go to the dances and this and that and one day she just wasn't there and when we asked where she went they said oh well you know she's gone to another hospital well sometime later I was in the day hospital and I happened to ask a nurse if she'd heard what had happened to this lady and she said oh that's her sitting over there and I looked and there was a fat lady that just looked like she was made out of dough she didn't know me she didn't know herself she didn't know anybody she was gone now that's a death did you ever try and get away from there did you ever say I'm just not going back I tried I was home for the weekend and I had a pass for the weekend that's how they call it so when I was there I said I'm not going back there so I telephoned or somebody else in the house telephone and they said if you're not coming back we're sending the police after you so I remember being so upset I was crying I didn't want to go in and it was really like a concentration camp [Music] there was a gentleman who jumped off the roof of the Allen I don't think he had LSD but he had sleep therapy with with psychic driving you know with the driving tapes under his pillow and they told him he was going to go home and he just come out of sleep therapy and he just jumped he said when around big smile on his face said goodbye to everybody and up on the roof and jumped off and landed at the back door of the atma which was the dreadful awful thing I don't think he was more than 30 and he was just gone just gone and there was this big wash to her yet the back door nobody would go in and out of that back door for a long time and everybody in the huh and the hospital spoke in hushed tones and everybody was affected they would not talk about it it was the silic did not happen in 1973 all MK ULTRA files under the control of the technical services division chief of the CIA were ordered destroyed by the director Richard Helms but in a bureaucracy as vast as the Central Intelligence Agency it's difficult to destroy everything and the damning evidence of the Cameron project surfaced after a Freedom of Information Act suit it revealed mrs. Orly Co had reason for her nightmares and her doubts I've heard that it was the most brutal program under that under MKULTRA in the States and in Canada that this was the most brutal it was an awful feeling to realize when I found this out that the man whom I had thought cared about what happened to me didn't give a damn I was a fly just to fly her husband David Orlick Oh NDP Member of Parliament for 22 years remembers the cost we had Blue Cross coverage but we didn't have but Blue Cross did not cover treatment in a mental hospital so what we did that after the first year was to sell the house which was really the only money that we had and my daughter and I moved in with the house mother and we stayed there almost three years it was it was tough but the financial cost was really a small part of the cost to be talking about cost it really it really disrupted our lives mrs. Orlick Oh sued the our Memorial Institute and last year it quietly settled out of court for $50,000 but that's only the amount she estimates she had to pay for what she thought was treatment apart from giving mrs. Orlick Oh her money back the alum has done nothing to compensate Cameron's other victims but in the u.s. a former CIA director Stansfield Turner promised the Congress the agency would try and track down victims of the MKULTRA project in both Canada and the US so they might get compensation the CIA wrote the Allan this recently Declassified letter addressed to Maurice Don J then director it said it has been our understanding that there are no remaining records of dr. Cameron's research that might reveal the identities of patients under his care during the time period in question however by way of leaving no stone unturned we now inquire whether this information might be reconstituted through patient records financial records or other hospital records Sincerely Yours Daniel B silver General Counsel CIA so even the CIA made some effort to find the victims but little help from Montreal there is no record of the Allen ever attempting a search of all its medical records although Cameron's successor admits it would be easy enough to do CIA documents show that 53 people in Montreal were subjected to the kay ultra experiments but only nine of those have been positively identified apart from Orlick ohyou art and Logie there were three Montreal housewives one of whom is now institutionalized there's a Montreal businessman who never really got his life together again after the experiments and another man who has been destitute for most of the time since ironically enough one of the victims is now a psychiatrist practicing in Eastern Ontario she obviously functions well enough but after the experiments ten years of her memory was wiped right out the McGill project was abruptly terminated in 1964 and so dr. Cameron returned to the United States three years later he died suddenly of a heart attack subsequent evaluation of Cameron's work in Montreal by his successor showed that the intensive shock therapy was not only medically useless but potentially dangerous Cameron though never revealed how much he knew about the CIA sponsorship of his work Robert Logie was later given cortisone treatment for the pains in his leg that brought him to the Allen in the first place it worked but his mind is a different story he now has joined with mrs. Orlick Oh madam cured and six other Canadians in a massive lawsuit against the United States government they contend that they sought treatment and instead were made unwitting victims of CIA experiments the nine Canadians are seeking 1 million dollars apiece in damages from the US government the CIA intimidates many American law firms but this case is being fought by a lawyer who defended Lillian Hellman and Arthur Miller during the McCarthy witch hunts for communists in preparation the lawyers have interrogated every CIA agent involved in MKULTRA including former director Helms with the trial expected to start soon Joseph raw sums up the case with his junior partner James Turner John get injure is the former CIA staff agent who testified at his request the CIA contacted Cameron and informed him that up front and New York would support his work as a result of that Cameron received CIA funds to finance the LSD and brainwashing --tx but other ways camera on all he did was what the CIA was in effect asking him to do and what he said he was going to do and he did it and they I paid him money for it and then what about Godley now we got a lot of stuff out of a godly here's one of his depositions we got him I take it he said I'm gonna wash my hands of this I'm approved the project but I don't have to take care of the Canadian citizens are gonna be affected is that fair that's very admitted that they took no steps whatsoever to guarantee that people wouldn't be injured if it could be avoided or to make sure that people even knew that they were participating in an experiment well this guy Godley he's got quite a record of the on negligent action ahead of time I mean before this ever he was personally involved in an experiment that resulted in the death of a US Army is that the one where they put the LSD and the cuatro of a guy named Olsen yeah and then he jumped out of a window and committed suicide in New York City they managed to cover that up too I like a man who his general counsel CIA his name's Larry Huston and at that time he said this was culpable negligence he was a general counsel and they went on left a guy on the job who had been guilty according to their own lawyer of culpable night what about Helms we took his deposition bill is right here yeah it's an awful thick deposition he didn't remember a whole lot there's a major case of forget me it's the only thing that he we really got out of him was that he instructed Gottlieb the CIA's dr. Gottlieb to destroy the records when the story broke about the covert CIA activities on Canadian soil the United States sent a formal apology to the Trudeau government but External Affairs Minister Allen McKagan has refused to release that document to mrs. Orlick oh and the others in the lawsuit this Declassified State Department letter shows why address to the Canadian embassy it reads this is with reference to your request for the views of the US intelligence community concerning possible release by the Canadian government of certain documents relating to the oil echo matter your request was given careful review on the basis of which it has been requested that the Canadian government withhold from disclosure the documents in question we've moved heaven and earth to get the correspondence and the documents of the discussions between the Canadian government and the United States the United States won't give it to us because they're covering up they're wrong the Canadian government won't give it to us because they're scared of the United States government both of them are holding back all of the information about this I think the case could be broken if the Canadian government would say to the CIA we're not gonna cover up for you any longer we're gonna allow then we're gonna give this material to mr. Arley Co for his case well if the Canadian government has this apology from the US why in the world do you think they wouldn't release it oh I just think the Canadian government's a little bit like international wimps in the case of the United States I don't know why they're so scared of us we're not gonna do anything I don't think the Seventh Army is gonna attack Montreal because you give us that material I understand though that the the American position is that this kind of CIA material can't be released for national security reasons maybe that's true well security my neck French the CIA the that everything they forget then when they have to stop forgetting because it's ludicrous then they say it's all national security what is national security about the apologies of the United States to Canada they get very belligerent Canadians with the Russians when I shoot down the double-oh-seven with some Canadian citizens but when the CIA covertly does something to all the citizen ruin the lives of many of these citizens while the Canadian governments do it nothing I don't know why Canada made forceful representations on behalf of the Toronto businessman who was kidnapped by bounty hunters taken back to Florida that wouldn't indicate that they're afraid to make a ruckus downtown that was a pretty easy situation I mean my god you kidnap a Canadian I'd take him to the United States heavens above and furthermore you who do you have to fight they're a couple of bounty hunters here you're fighting a CIA that scares the Canada I'm surprised that if your case is as strong as you say that the American government isn't trying to get an out-of-court settlement pay out a bunch of money and just hope it'll go away when the CIA went into this brainwashing stuff what they call the MKULTRA program when they went into that they injured lots more people than the nine we are suing for they injured a great many other here and here in the United Stated states they may feel that they've got so many skeletons in their closet that's settling with us even though we're clearly right and they would like it to go away would hurt them as a precedent I can't think of any other reason that they're being so really rough on us I think there is a duty on the government to to release in a matter such as this all of the information it has ala Lawrence is the conservative justice critic in the Commons it's been government complicity or government negligence so be it you know it's far better to make a full disclosure and and and a full confession of your sins in a matter such as this it's always a difficult thing for anybody to sue a government or sue an agency in the government and if you don't have the cooperation of your own government in doing that a few strikes against you right off the bat if the process was reversed it was some sort of a secretive Canadian operation taking place in the United States I'm sure all hell would break loose down there as far as beating of breasts and waving of flags and whatnot if the material came from the states perhaps they're bound by if not law good manners to not turn it over if the source of the information doesn't want it turned over I don't know about manners I don't know about international matters very much but I know this if I were in charge of a government to whom nine citizens that we are suing for have been brainwashed without their knowing have had their lives in pain and have it done by a foreign agency undercover without the Government of Canada knowing it I would find a way to help those people instead of hindering them we tried to ask External Affairs Minister McKellen why the Government of Canada is not helping these Canadian citizens who were victimized by agents of another country but for more than two months mr. McCracken has been unavailable to discuss the matters what do you want to tell mr. McKevitt for example about what happened to you how you feel about it now I would tell him to try what we've been through and see what he would have to say after because only when you go through such an experience one can say how bad it can be and hope thankful I'd say come on get off your horse and help us we need some help from our government we are innocent victims of something that happened that should never have been and you can't make it you can't put us back where we were but at least do something to help us now do something to stand up and say this can't happen in Canada what can you possibly get for your clients out of this case you can't get their health back that's not possible and there are older people and some of them may die during this stonewalling by the CIA and some of them may get worse one of them at least is in an institution now I mean the thing is very much needed needing of speed by the to get regular you can get some money that's all you can get so you can get it when a doctor a miss operates on you know you don't get your health back there's no way we'd get our hell of their health back but what we can get them is some funds to help ameliorate their old age with the damage that's been done to them by this lousy performance and occurred through the CIA by camera on mistreating him and hurting them one thing which triggered mrs. who are initial depression was growing deafness in one year that was later corrected with minor surgery but no surgery can undo dr. Cameron's work at Raven's Craig I cannot go to sleep without any medication I have migraine headaches that last for a week at the time doctors cannot find a cause I have slight amnesia I have a lot of trouble to concentrate I've never been able to sleep without medication since to sleep freely I went through years and years and years of severe depressions I dream about it I all my all my waking hours to think about it it's like it's eating me up I've been hospitalized when I first went home to Winnipeg I attempted to take my own life because I couldn't enjoy the way I felt and I have a a chronic need I'm very dependent on other people and I have a chronic depression which at times gets worse not being with my family not being able to follow a career not being able to study anymore which I wanted to do very much I would say it cost me my life you ",1
572,"ANTONY DAVIES: Myths about the government debt. Myth number one, the government owes 20 trillion dollars. How much is 20 trillion dollars? Suppose you go to Germany, and in Germany, you go to every town. In every town, you visit every store. In every store, you look at every shelf and grab everything that is for sale. The amount of money you spend will not be $20 trillion. If you go to Germany and then to France and you go to every town, and within every town, you go to every store. In every store, you look on every shelf and you buy everything. You still will not have spent $20 trillion. You can go to England and while you're there, you can go to the North Countries and buy everything that's for sale, and you still will not have spent $20 trillion. In fact, to spend $20 trillion, you have to go to every country in Europe, visit every town, in every town, go to every store. In every store, look on every shelf and buy everything. And then you will have spent about $20 trillion. But the myth is that this is how much money the government owes. It turns out that there's more, called unfunded obligations. Unfunded obligations is money the Federal Government has promised but which it does not and will not have the money to pay. Largely, this consists of promises of retirement and medical benefits. If you would take the present value of all the future promises of retirement and medical benefits the government has made and subtract from that the amount of money that's in the government's Social Security and Medicare trust funds, and then subtract from that the amount of money the Federal Government anticipates collecting under the current law from future Social Security and Medicare taxes, you will still have an amount of money left over that the government does not have. And that's the unfunded obligations, an amount of money the government has promised, which it does not and will not have the money to pay. Estimates of unfunded obligations vary from the astronomical to the unbelievable. On the low end, people have estimated unfunded obligations to be about $80 trillion, on the high end, $200 trillion. This means that the Federal Government's total financial obligations range somewhere from 100 to $220 trillion. Let's say, roughly speaking, the Federal Government owes about $150 trillion. Myth number two, the government owes $150 trillion. Well, it turns out there's more to it. There are federal agencies that don't appear on the Federal Government's budget. There are government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that don't appear on the government's financial statements, and they owe another $8 trillion. There's then state and local governments that collectively owe about $3 trillion and have another 5 trillion in their own unfunded obligations. When we put it all together, the total US governmental financial obligations total about $165 trillion. Myth number three, government borrowed from the Social Security trust fund isn't really debt because we owe it to ourselves. Well, it turns out there is no ourselves here. The trust fund belongs to current and future retirees. So when people retire and the government does not have the money that it has promised them, one of two things must happen. Either the government must increase taxes on future workers to pay for the Social Security and Medicare obligations it has promised, or the government has to cut the promised Social Security and Medicare benefits that it had promised to retirees. Either way, someone must pay. Myth number four, the government can't go bankrupt. This is technically true because the government promised to pay back a certain number of dollar bills. And so as the government starts to run out of money, it can simply print more, thereby satisfying its obligation. But while that's technically true, it's effectively false because when the government prints money, it erodes the purchasing power of dollars, thereby creating inflation. For example, suppose you have a bunch of people and these people buy things. They buy things from Wal Mart, from Mcdonald's, and Ford. In buying these things, they give these businesses money. In return, they receive goods and services from these businesses. The ratio of the dollars they pay to the goods and services they receive, we call prices. We have the average price of a hamburger, the average price of a pair of shoes, the average price of a car. Now, if the government were to print enough money to double the money supply, we would have twice as many dollar bills floating around but the same amount of goods and services. All that would happen is the prices of these goods and services themselves would double. With twice as many dollar bills, a hamburger now goes from a price of $4 to a price of 8. The car goes from $30,000 to a price of $60,000. One of the prices that will double is people's wages. Interestingly, you're left with the following. Under scenario one, without the government printing money, let's suppose you earn $50,000 a year and the price of a hamburger, shoes, and a car, things you would buy, are $4, $30, and $30,000. And then along comes a government who prints lots of money, and in printing the money, it doubles all the prices, including your income. So now, in scenario two, you're earning twice as much as you were before, $100,000, but the prices of the things you buy have all doubled as well. If I ask you, are you better off in scenario one or scenario two, the answer is you're the same in both. It doesn't matter to you whether you're earning $50,000 and a car costs 30, or whether you're earning $100,000 and a car costs 60. It's the same car. Now, there is a difference in the two scenarios, and the difference shows up when you look at your savings. Let's suppose, in scenario one, you had $10,000 in savings, you're earning $50,000, and a hamburger costs $4. Along comes the government, it prints money. In printing money, all the prices double. That means that the hamburger now costs twice as much, the shoes cost twice as much, you're earning twice as much, but your savings is the same. It's the same $10,000 sitting in savings. What has happened, when the government comes along and prints money, in effect, what it's doing is draining away the purchasing power of your savings. Economists say it this way, ""Inflation is a tax on savings."" When the government prints money and thereby creates inflation, we get the same exact effect as if the government had imposed a tax on people's savings. The fact is that the government ultimately pays for bankruptcy by taxing the purchasing power of people's savings. Myth number five, the government can solve its financial problems by raising taxes. Well, it turns out the government can't raise taxes at all, it can only raise tax rates. Taxes are what happens when the tax rate that the government impose interacts with people's behavior. This is perhaps the most interesting picture in all of economics. It's interesting precisely because it's so boring. What you're seeing here is federal tax receipts. This is all tax revenue from all sources combined, payroll taxes, income taxes, estate taxes, tariffs, everything, federal taxes, all sources combined, as a fraction of GDP. What you see is, from 1950 up to the present, this has remained relatively stable at about 17%. That is, over time, if you think of the economy as a pie, the government has collected a constant 17% slice of this economic pie. Now, let's superimpose on top of this, for example, the top marginal income tax rate. Back in the 1950s, the top marginal income tax rate was north of 90%. It dropped in the 1960s, reached an all-time low during the Reagan years, goes back up during Bush the first, comes back down, goes back up again. This is the top marginal income tax rate. When you talk about taxing the rich, this is the rate that applies to the rich. But notice what happens here. In years in which we taxed the rich at a very high rate, the government collected 17% of the economy as tax revenue. In years in which we lowered the tax rate on the rich, the government still collected 17% of the economy as tax revenue. The same is true of, for example, the capital gains rate. When capital gains taxes were particularly high, the government collected 17% of the economy as tax revenue. When capital gains taxes were particularly low, the government collected 17% of the economy as tax revenue. The same is true of the average effective corporate tax rate. When corporations paid higher fractions of their profits to the Federal Government, the Federal Government collected 17% of the economy as tax revenue. When tax rates on corporations were lower, the government still collected the same 17% of the economy as tax revenue. It didn't matter whether we taxed the rich or capital gains or corporations. It didn't matter whether we taxed them a high amount or we taxed them a low amount. Regardless of what the government has done, historically, it has consistently collected the same 17% of the economy as tax revenue. Now, you might say, ""All right, but we\'re looking at tax revenue as a fraction of GDP. Tell me what\'s happening to tax revenue, straight up."" Let's look at what happens to tax revenue as tax rates change. What you see here is the top marginal income tax rate. This is data from 1940 to 2015. Across the bottom as we move to the right, we're taxing the rich at a higher rate. As we move to the left, we're taxing the rich at a lower rate. Up and down, we're measuring tax revenue per person, one year later. This is total federal tax revenue on a per capita basis, one year after the tax rate goes into effect, and this is all adjusted for inflation. The story we hear when we hear things like, ""Well, we need more tax revenue so we need to tax the rich more,"" implicit in that statement is as you increase the tax rate on the rich, we will collect more tax revenue. But if we actually look at the data, what we see is a different picture. The actual data looks like this. On average, as we have increased the tax rate on the rich, one year later, the Federal Government has actually collected, on average, less tax revenue. There are exceptions to this but there's also a very clear trend that the tax revenue moves in the opposite direction that we think it should. This is not just true of the top marginal income tax rate. We also see it if we look at the capital gains tax rate. Now, the relationship here is not as tight but it's disturbingly in the same direction. On average, as the government has increased the capital gains tax rate, one year later, it has collected less tax revenue than it did before. We see the same phenomenon with the corporate profits tax. We see the same thing with the estate tax. In fact, of all the federal taxes, I'm only aware of two which, historically, as the government has increased these tax rates, its tax revenue has actually gone up. Those two taxes are Social Security and Medicare. The disturbing part of this is these are the taxes that fall most heavily on the poor and the middle class. Myth number six, the rich aren't paying their fair share. What constitutes a fair share? What you see here is average market income of various income groups in the United States as of 2013. We have the poorest 20% of Americans at the top. Their market income, that is income they earn from participating in market activities as opposed to money the government gives them, their market income is about $15,800 on average. Here's the middle-income Americans, their average income is about $53,000, and the top 1%, just over $1.5 million. Let's ask, what is a fair tax rate for these people to pay? As we talk about tax rates, let's talk about effective tax rates. What I mean by that is after you have done all of your legal and accounting gymnastics and write-offs and deductions and exemptions, when all that's finished, what fraction of your income did you end up paying to the IRS? That's the effective tax rate. We can argue about what constitutes fair. A lot of people tend to answer the following way, the poor should probably pay somewhere around 2%. A lot of people think that the middle-class Americans should pay around 15%. And a lot of people think that the top 1% should pay around 30% of their income as taxes. Now, we could argue about whether these things are indeed fair but these seem to be numbers that lots of people will tend to agree with. Let's look at what these groups actually pay. If we look at the federal taxes collected from each of these groups, we see something like the following. The average household amongst the poorest 20% of Americans pays, on average, $800 in federal taxes. The average middle-income household in the United States pay about $9,000 in taxes. The average household amongst the top 1% pays about half-a-million dollars in federal taxes. Now, this isn't the end of the story because we don't just pay money to the Federal Government, the Federal Government also gives money back. A lot of this comes in the form of the earned income tax credit or Social Security benefits or unemployment compensation, but all of these things are instances in which the government has first collected money and then turned around and given the money back. Let's account for this, and economists call this transfers. Transfers are money the government gives to people. The average household amongst the poorest 20% received an average federal transfer of about $9,600 in 2013. The average middle-income household received about $16,700. The average top 1%-er earned about $800, most of that is likely coming from Social Security retirement benefits. But notice what happens now, if we calculate the effective tax rate by accounting not just for what people pay to the government but for the money the government pays them back, what we find is something astounding. We claimed that a fair tax rate for the poorest Americans is 2%, and a fair tax rate for the top 1% is 30%. If we run these numbers, what we find is the poorest 20%, on average, are actually paying -56%. That is, when all the dust settles, they're actually receiving more money back from the Federal Government than they paid in the first place, making their effective tax rate below zero. This is true all the way up through middle-income American. The average middle-income American is receiving back 15% more from the Federal Government than he paid in, the top 1%-er paying about 34%. Here, we have an interesting conclusion. On average, and there are exceptions but on average, only the top 40% are net payers into the Federal Government. This raises an interesting point because every time someone says, ""Well, we should cut taxes,"" someone else responds with, ""Well, you mean tax cuts for the rich."" But in fact, our tax system, at least at the federal level, has become so progressive that virtually every tax cut, by definition, is a tax cut for the rich because on average, those are the only people who are actually paying. Myth number seven, the government can settle its debts by selling off its assets. The government has some debts and unfunded obligations of about $150 trillion but it's also sitting on a bunch of assets, 8,000 tons of gold in Fort Knox, 500 million acres of land out in the West and Midwest, and then miscellaneous assets on top of that. These total actually only about 2 or $3 trillion. When we're done, even if the Federal Government were to sell off all of its assets, we still have a shortfall of $147 trillion. Myth number eight, the government needs to pay off its debts. The good news here is the government actually doesn't need to pay off its debt. Just as a household with a credit card does not have to pay off the credit card, all it has to do is keep up with the minimum monthly payments, so too the government only needs to keep up with its minimum monthly payments. We call this servicing the debt. The bad news is if we count all of the money the Federal Government owes, $150 trillion, and the Federal Government currently pays about 2.5% on its debt, to service the full $150 trillion of obligations, the Federal Government would have to come up with $3.8 trillion per year. That is, to service the debt and obligations the Federal Government currently has, it would have to pay $3.8 trillion a year in interest. Yet, the Federal Government's annual income is only about 3.3 trillion. That is, the Federal Government actually is bankrupt right now. Even if it were to devote all of the tax revenue it collects solely to servicing its $150 trillion in debt and obligations, it still would not have enough money to service that debt. Myth number nine, well, the government could just keep on borrowing. The problem here is the government has borrowed so much money that it's running out of places to find more. Currently, the American people, state and local governments have loaned about $6 trillion to the Federal Government. Social Security, Medicare, Veterans Benefits trust funds have loaned about $5 trillion to the Federal Government. Foreign governments have loaned another 4 trillion. The Federal Reserve has loaned 3 trillion, and foreign people have loaned about 2 trillion. This is the total amount of money that people the world over have loaned to the Federal Government. The problem with this is Social Security, Medicare, Veterans Benefits trust funds have run out of money. They have no more left to loan to the Federal Government. In fact, in the case of Social Security and Medicare, they're starting to pull back the money that they had loaned to the Federal Government, which they now need to turn over to retirees in the form of benefits. Foreign governments and foreign people have been slowing the growth of their lending to the Federal Government. The American people, state and local governments have been slowing, and in some cases, actually cutting back on how much they loan the Federal Government. That means that as time moves forward and the Federal Government wants to borrow more and more money and these groups are all tending to cut back on how much they loan, the one place left the Federal Government can turn to for money is the Federal Reserve. The problem here is when the government borrows from the Federal Reserve, unlike its borrowing from any of these other groups, it creates inflation. Inflation is a tax on savings. In effect, as the Federal Government runs out of places to borrow, it must turn to the Federal Reserve to borrow money. When it does that, it creates inflation, which erodes the purchasing power of all of our savings. Myth number 10, there's no way to fix this problem. It turns out that there is. We could have a balanced budget within five years if we followed this recipe. First, cut all spending this year by 10%, no exceptions. If there's some things you don't want to cut by 10%, then cut something else by more so that when you're done, in total, you have cut by 10%. When I say cut by 10%, I mean the word in the way any normal human being uses it. When politicians say, ""Cut the budget,"" what they mean is to increase the budget by less than they would actually like. This is a actual 10% cut. We spend 10% less than we did the year before. Then hold spending constant for four years, don't even adjust for inflation. What happens over these four years is as the government holds its spending constant, the economy continues to grow. At the end of the fifth year, the economy is now large enough that it can support the government that exists. At the end of the fifth year, we'll have our first balanced budget. Thereafter, the Federal Government can continue to increase its spending if it likes, provided that the increase does not outpace the growth rate of the economy as a whole. This solution stops the bleeding. It prevents the debt problem from getting worse, but it doesn't solve the debt problem. However, we can grow out of this. It took perhaps 100 years for our debt problem to grow to the size it is now. If we can stop the problem from getting worse, over the course of the next 50 or 100 years, the economy will grow enough that the current $150 trillion debt won't matter.",1
321,how America I'm Marc Levin this is life Liberty and Levin welcome nice to see it's a great honor to see you Patrick Michael doctor expert on all things climate environment as far as I'm concerned a little bit of your background the director of the Center for study of science at the cato institute you hold an a b and sm you all those degrees in biology sciences and plant ecology of the university of chicago pretty good school PhD in ecological climatology from the university of wisconsin-madison 1979 your past president of the American Association of state climatologists you were programmed chairman for the Committee on apply' climatology of the American Meteorological Society say that satisfied time yeah you were research professor of environmental sciences at the University of Virginia for 30 years and I'm giving an extensive you know background that you have them I'm giving that to the public so they know you really know what you're talking about and you're a contributing author and air reviewer the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 let's get started climate change global warming global cooling we've heard it all what's going on out there well surface temperature the planet is warmer than it was a hundred years ago about nine tenths of a degree Celsius nine tenths of a degree Celsius all a lot no it's not a lot there are two periods of warming one in the early 20th century that could not have been caused by human beings because we hadn't put enough co2 in the air and one in the later part of the 20th century that either slows down or ends depending upon whose data you use somewhere in the late 1990s only to resume with the big El Nino that covered the news over the last couple of years so that means that probably about half maybe half of that nine tenths of a degree might be caused by greenhouse gases because when the planet warmed beginning in 1976 the temperature of the stratosphere started to drop and that's a prediction of greenhouse theory that's not intuitive you know the great philosopher of science Karl Popper said if you can meet a difficult prediction with your theory you can continue to entertain your theory so the theory is right but the application of it is wrong it is nowhere near as warm as it's supposed to be the computer models are making systematic dramatic errors over the entire tropics which is 40 percent of the earth and it's where all our moisture comes from or almost all of it and let me stop it yeah who does these computer models government's there are 32 families of computer models that are used by the United Nations each government sponsored and all of them are predicting far far too much warming the disparity between what's been predicted to happen which looks like this and what is happening continues to grow we know that for a fact yeah you think because you can just look at the weather balloon temperatures you can look at the satellite temperatures you can look at something called the reanalysis data they all behave in concert so they're showing the same thing and the same thing is a lot different than this thing however we need to call the special council especially council yes because one model works and you know what it is it's the Russian so let me get this you so all the government models are like this yeah the Russian model is like this yeah the Russian model is the least warming in it and the Russian model is the least warming and the Russian model pretty much follows reality yeah what's been tested over a few decades yeah correct you know if we were rational about this think about the daily weather forecast you know you watch The Weather Channel ago oh this model says that that model says that we think this one's working the best so we're gonna rely on that well for climate forecast we should be using the Russian model but we're not we use this big spate of all the other models that have this warming in them that's not occurring why are all these other government models 31 of them yeah wrong and why do they all go in the same direction up the because they are what is called parameterised that's they're all parameterised can I translate parameterize into English fudged okay don't get the right answer don't know the right answer for certain phenomena so we essentially put in code steps that give us what we think it should be and the systematic error that was made was the models were tuned as it said tuned tuned to simulate the warming of the early 20th century began in 1910 ended in 1945 about 0.45 degrees Celsius mark that could not have been caused by carbon dioxide because there wasn't and then we had to put enough in that the background carbon dioxide concentration is 280 parts per million when the second first warming started it was 298 parts per million if the atmosphere is that sensitive to an 18 ppm change in co2 we wouldn't be talking about this right now we'd be sweating bullets so what you're saying is man-made carbon dioxide earlier the last century could not have produced the early 20th century early 20th century could not have produced this heat so what did do we know no and you know three most important words in life not only I love you it might be I don't know I don't think anybody really knows what kicked off that warming there's a lots of theories one is that it was the final escape from a cold period multi century period known as the Little Ice Age that's a plausibility but why did it happen that but we just don't really have a good explanation for that but because we forced the computer models to say AHA human influenced co2 and other stuff we made the models too sensitive and so that's why when you get to the late 20th century all of a sudden they're warming up like crazy and the realities down here it was it was guaranteed to happen there this was revealed in science magazine in late 2016 and there was a paper that was published by a French climate modeler called the art and science of climate model tuning and in it he speaks of parameterizing we could say fudging the models to give his words an anticipated acceptable range of results so it's the scientist not the science that's determining how much it's gonna warm a lot of people don't know this but it happens to be true and you know we could speculate as to why that paper was published right before the 2016 election I wouldn't want to impute causation but gee if but I want to ask you about causation sure you have 31 governments though the 31 different models some are 31 different models the multiple governments right we're fudging the numbers they're not fudging them they're fudging them out rising okay well you use the word fudging there's our EPA do that does NASA do that does that for a ha good question mark because the EPA was told by the Supreme Court in 2007 that if it found the carbon dioxide endangered human health and welfare that it had the power to regulate it under the Clean Air Act this is the Massachusetts v EPA well they produced an endangerment finding 2009 and the endangerment finding for its prospective climate is 100% I didn't say 90 percent is it 100 percent based on those models so if you can demonstrate that those models systematically are not working you can take down the endangerment finding and that would be the basis for all those policies that came out of the Obama administration which would mean you don't get to regulate absolutely carbon dioxide is the heart of the matter and to give you an idea how gung the Obama administration was on this issue if you listen to his first inaugural speech January 20th 2009 it's the second substantive paragraph of the speech is about global warming after health care ninety days after he finished that speech his EPA produced a preliminary finding of endangerment from carbon dioxide they were working on this before he was president bureaucrats can't work that fast and then the final finding was made in December for the climate conference in Copenhagen that was supposed to produce another global war so you're telling us that we have a massive bit of public policy that has an enormous effect on society absolutely it's built on I'll use my word phony models it's built on a house of cards the models really don't work and and if I could really be arcane I can explain the mechanism as to why they don't work as I understand it the models systematically predict that as you go up in the atmosphere in the tropics which are 40% of the earth that the temperature should rise dramatically as you go further up in the atmosphere so when you get to the level of the jet stream the computer models are predicting seven times I didn't say seven tenths of a degree I said seven times more warming than is being observed well why is that important why am i boring you with that because it's a vertical distribution of temperature that determines upward motion which means it determines precipitation and guess what almost all the atmospheric moisture that we have around us today in humid Washington DC that comes from the tropics so if you get that vertical motion wrong down there you get all the subsequent variables wrong it's a fantastic systematic error and again that along with the difference between the surface temperatures are rather the lower atmospheric temperatures and what's being observed that's sufficient to kill the endangerment finding okay so to the average pedestrian me if you get that wrong what does that mean you get all the weather models wrong to get the subsequent weather wrong yeah and I mean that that's why if you look at all these families or models they predict radically different changes in precipitation from model to model well probably because they got the precipitation initialization out of the tropics wrong precipitation is important I offer you Wilmington North Carolina is an example that precipitation is important coming from the tropics get that wrong and you get that wrong is weather getting worse no there's it's I love that question because what do you really want to look at Roger pinky junior at University of Colorado does this yes there's more damage from weather because there's more stuff and people and property in the way of weather so what you really want to look at our weather damages as a percent of GDP and when you look at it that way there's nothing whatsoever oh I'm sure hurricanes are getting worse I heard that on every legacy Network during Lawrence Lawrence and Harvey and all that stuff well the fact the matter is you can there's a guy by the name of Ryan Maui who's just a hotshot young tropical meteorologist he's also a agile scholar Cato Institute and he tracks the energy in these tropical cyclones since they got global records that begin in 1970 and you would think there would be some relationship between that integrated energy and global warming after all it's only logical Vice President Gore says that must be the case it's not there's no relationship whatsoever between the accumulated cyclone energy and the surface temperature of the earth it's just not there now what wait a minute why does our government say this they said it in their last report called global climate change impacts in the United States they said oh there's been a significant increase in hurricane power in the Atlantic Ocean from like 1972 2009 or something like that 1980 to 2009 well wait a minute why to stop in 2009 was a 2014 report because if you take the data after 2009 9 the increase goes away and it goes back to where it was or why did you start in the mid-1970s because we have records that are really good back to 1920 and if you look 1920 to 1950 you see an increase it is exactly the same as the one that occurred there so the information they're providing us it's hugely it's skew scute their cherry-picking uh-huh and here we rely on the climatologists neurologists and they become hyper political and I want to get back absolutely that as soon as we return don't forget ladies and gentlemen you can watch Levin TV almost

324,clearly when you did this rally you would have known that you were breaking the law technically did that bother you uh well that isn't right we had a lot of ongoing discussions with the police and everything was okay and they agreed to um enable our rally to end in a march to downing street so there was completely no problem at all uh we are a political rally and those are allowed however at the last minute a different group of policemen turned up and arrested me and when i was in the van i asked them what is going on and they indicated let's say that this came from on high so as far as we can see is a political decision to arrest me whereas allowing a black lives matter uh event at the same time or or further done that down into parliament square allow that to happen what was the reason what was the reason given to you yeah i mean you raised an interesting point i'm not really sure why you're being singled out uh for a ten thousand pound fight when there have clearly been a lot of other mass protests what was the reason given to you absolutely as to why you have been targeted when as you said so many black lives matter protests have taken place yeah anyone being fine peter's uh peers interesting talking appears to be yeah we don't meet many other people no they didn't give i actually have a brother i have a brother called jeremy to make things even more weird that's good no they they didn't give a reason as to why i was singled out and i think you uh peers should challenge sadiq khan to explain why he's got political policing in london now and also challenge him if it's not political allow us to have another rally on the 26th of september just before parliament okay well i would say i would say i don't understand i don't understand why you've been single again 26th of september yeah on that point i can uh agree with you it seems irrational and unfair but should we look at that and we will lastly let's get to what you were actually protesting about do you believe the coronavirus do you believe the coronavirus pandemic is real well there's various views on this i mean some some doctors say uh that actually what we're seeing is some sort of flu that's been around for 46 years and others say well uh it doesn't exist at all there isn't actually a virus what's your view everything which happens is exaggerated well let me well uh what we're doing is we're challenging the government to give actual evidence that there is a virus and we've given them until the fifth of september to reply to show understand the prime minister himself was hospitalized with the virus how much more evidence do you need well was he hospitalized with the virus or was he ill from something else you see there's a lot of claims going on uh and of course there might have been something happening in the past you're suggesting the british prime minister invented okay just to clarify you are suggesting the british prime minister invented having a virus that may not exist i don't know if anyone in invented it or not but i would say that uh the numbers of people getting whatever they're getting is declining rapidly and there's no justification whatsoever mr corbin let me just jump in just to clarify the numbers 25 million people around the world have tested positive for chronovirus covert 19. well yeah and over 800 yeah let me finish the question then i will let you ask this don't work do not worry let me finish the question and overdose don't interrupt me i won't i'll let you answer over 800 000 people have now died from covet 19. that is a demonstrable fact now what part of that do you think does not constitute a pandemic well 800 000 people have died and they've been labelled covid when it might have been completely something else it is not a pandemic because the numbers dying are nothing different from a normal year of people dying as they die all the time and secondly it is not a high consequence infectious disease and that was declared by the government and the world health organization on march the 19th so what we have is a psychological operation a psychological operation to close down the economy in the interests of mega corporations more than 40 000 people have died in this country as a result of covid directly people are dying pharmaceutical companies listen well it is boosting pharmaceutical companies and and big telecom who are making billions and billions out of this while the ordinary british worker is going to the wall losing jobs if those pharma companies are coming up with treatment that can help people who are suffering and potentially find a vaccine that can prevent long-term illness there's no need for a vaccine that isn't no no no no vaccines cause death history of that listen to me listen to me you're interrupting you're interrupting the history of the recent modern vaccines shows they make people more ill there is already a cure for these covered symptoms namely chloroquine and zinc so there's no need because you the viewers are paying for it mr corbin if you may let me jump in what are you telling me about how your clock's glorious it's not a cure for covid19 that's a complete lie it's not a cure no the doctors who've done it have said so and it works no they haven't there's no evidence i don't mind you coming on and talking about these things but if you're going to state bold lies like hydroxychloroquine 19 that is simply not true i'm relying on expert doctors on expert doctors say this and i suggest what you say isn't true you're relying on conspiracy theorists listen to doctors conspiracy theory when you've got nothing to say okay on vaccines what happened with what happened with measles if vaccines don't work yes these are earlier type of vaccines i'm talking about modern vaccines did it work the vaccine for measles did it work um it might well have worked but the vaccines of the past are different from the ones now which have many additives which are in general dangerous and the statistics show that more people get lower immune systems when they've had that okay let's bring in doctor hillary someone who is an extrovert doctor who may be very concerned frankly about what you're saying dr hillary um extremely dangerous to corbyn and his statements are littered with errors absolutely littered with dangerous errors the hydroxychloroquine and zinc for example completely dissed by hundreds of different experts let me tell you about the virus the virus has been identified by the electron microscope we have sequenced the entire ribonucleic acid genome so we know exactly that this is a new virus it has nothing to do with viruses that we've seen in the last 40 years all of your statements are not only dangerous let me tell you about modern vaccine you say that the old vaccines could have worked and they absolutely did work measles for example we saw 460 000 cases every year of measles before vaccination after that we saw 130 a reduction of 99.9 percent we're talking meningitis which kills 10 of people was introduced the vaccine was introduced in 1999 quite recently and we saw numbers decreased from 883 to 28 more than that a reduction of 97 and a huge reduction in mortality you are dangerous you shouldn't be preaching you're not medically qualified i don't know where you get your rubbish fake news and you shouldn't be honest the real uh that i think probably i think you probably nailed it dr hillary about modern vaccines modern vaccines work very well meningococcal meningitis go and have a look at this so-called testing here's corbin let me ask you this let me ask you this question do you believe his dna and rna rather than finding let me ask you another question mr corbin i understand maybe one that maybe give them a chance yeah mrs corbyn do you believe there is a link between 5g masts uh and covet well that's the question is not correctly posed the important thing to understand is that electromagnetic radiation 4g 5g and and you know normal wi-fi which is mostly 4g do lower your immune systems and the statistics show very clearly and this is proven by objective tesco and over years that those things do indeed it's actually completed what you've just said is what you've just said no with this it's utter nonsense measurement so 5g is 66 times below the safety limit for harmful radiation meaning it is not strong enough to harm ourselves or have a negative effect on our immune system the important thing is not the amount of radiation the important thing is the frequency you're arguing just like the tobacco lobby we have a new tobacco lobby they said warm in your lungs doesn't matter it was the tar that mattered and the same thing with climate change is uh it's the frequency that matters and climate change is another hoax yeah man-made fossil fuels all the hoax everything made up well the the the sun the sun rules uh weather and climate and i can tell you that christmas in britain is going to be very cold and we might even have snow there and this comes from our long-range corporate killings do you feel as incensed as dr hillary shock horror it's going to be cold in winter and there might be some snow that's just the most vague baking that anyone's ever said slow on christmas day no no i'm letting you know there might be still on christmas day i thought that we should excite peers all piercers get excited by snow on christmas day okay well the world cup change is very very weird piece corbin can i ask you do you have these conversations with your brother who wanted to be a british prime minister do i have what the what do you have these same conversations with your brother jeremy uh well i have many conversations i mean i i'm sure we agree on many things about the current british economy and the crashing of jobs which is an utter monstrosity and i say the answer to that is end lockdowns now and save jobs save lives save the economy save culture how many of your views does he agree with how many views i don't know but we agree on many things and we disagree on a number of things does he believe covered does he believe covered 19 exists or does he think like you it's all been drummed up by the evil pharmaceutical i know i'm saying this no listen listen to me i said we're giving the government a chance to prove understand the tests that it exists of course it exists peers called they've got proof you're talking complete nonsense man i'm saying we're giving them a chance,1
486,[Music] one of the reasons that i wanted to make this film was that i personally related a lot to the satanist and their mission not because i'm a satanist or because i'm particularly engaged in like a church day battle of my own more that i feel a kinship with people who choose to do the difficult work of being heretics you know society needs skeptics and it needs outsiders to stand up for themselves and to like fight against the dominant ideas we need that that's really healthy to have that and so i really appreciated the the role that they were taking on in this particular cultural context and i related to it personally because i feel a kinship to the kind of person who kind of doesn't mind if their point of view upsets you like it's like not a problem for me if my point of view upsets somebody in it but it is a difficult thing to do it does generate a lot of hate uh and animosity how do those themes around satan and satanism resonate right now for me it seems kind of obvious that there's been a complete reversal in the roles of who's ostensibly the good guys and who are the bad guys right now we have evangelical nationalists pushing a theocratic agenda in the united states and making great headway to take away people's reproductive rights endorse corporal punishment in schools uh spread pseudoscience or otherwise reject a scientific point of view in really undermining liberal democracy so at this point there seems to be an impair apparent intuitive grasp of what satan can mean in a heroic context and i think you see that vindicated in the film when you see how quickly we've grown and how how much that kind of iconography has resonated with people they instantly seem to grasp it some people don't of course and and object it out object to it outright but we have seen that you know it speaks to people in ways that we could have never predicted from the start the main challenge in figuring out how to structure the story of the film is simply that the satanic temple is doing so much um you know a lot of their activities that were really important and interesting didn't make it into the film um you know 95 minutes is not that long um especially because we wanted to make sure we covered the beginning like we wanted this to feel like this is the origin story of the satanic temple we wanted to leave it feeling very much like this is not the end of the story so it was difficult to leave a lot of the really amazing work they do out and it was also a little bit difficult to predict what was going to happen i mean there was just a lot of activity and we were chasing you know different chapters around the country doing really exciting things in their local communities and you know national campaigns and there's just a lot uh to sort of navigate but you know we just tried to keep true to like what would be what would be like the best starting point for an average audience member and then with that in mind how can we make sure we're not doing a disservice to the more informed satanist who watches the film and i don't want them to feel like their intelligence is being insulted so finding the balance you know with the uninitiated and then also wanting to be sure that satanist would like it too was i think pretty hard i think we did a good job but it was difficult since the start of the trump administration there's been even more pushback against what you do yeah but there's been also that kind of concurrent uh understanding of a need for the kind of activities that the satanic temple are doing within hours of trump being declared president our membership numbers really spiked and if we looked at the metrics for our website and other kind of web activity it was like a straight line upward on uh on election night because people realized that this was you know if they viewed it as a joke before it wasn't a joke anymore and that the the the uh rise of theocracy was was very real a lot of people don't understand like just how big of a part the evangelical rights vote played in the election of donald trump and we leave this out of the film because frankly we didn't want to look at his face um but you know it's sort of in the world around us right like is as much as like donald trump himself is like certainly not a believer in anything you know the evangelical right really did a lot of work to elect him and so and he's repaid them in various ways and so i feel like the work the satanic temple is doing is particularly resonant now i also think that we're in such dark political times that people who maybe typically wouldn't uh care what the satanists have to say uh might be a little more open-minded in their desperation for answers but the theocratic right has been emboldened by the election of donald trump and as soon as he was elected you could see these kinds of bills against abortion being pushed to be passed in states like texas and ohio against you know fetal heartbeat bans as soon as the fetus starts a heartbeat they were saying that's about six weeks sometimes women don't even know they're pregnant at that point trying to ban abortions trying to ban abortions outright and pushing other kind of theocratic agendas nationwide and there's a very centralized well-organized well-financed force trying to undermine the the very spirit of the united states constitution and give exclusive privilege to one religious viewpoint and we're really a grassroots movement without any of that financing and without any of that networking yet and we're making great strides just because the law really is on our side at least for now do you see anything satanic about trump no we're not mindless agents of chaos and when you look at trump he is absolutely mindless that that man is is about as stupid as they could possibly get he's not qualified to work a stock boy job at a grocery store he's completely unaware of his failings right so there's there's no no drive for knowledge there and there's no no real appeal to scientific fact upon which he bases his beliefs which is something we strive to do every day and it's not that we're just looking for disorder chaos and to undermine uh western civilization in fact we're trying to really endorse for enlightenment values bringing reason and respect for science into bettering the human condition and that has nothing to do with trump's agenda planning any big you know stunts or sort of like ironic events or anything going forward that you know we may hear about before long well we're actually uh researching now the possibility of opening up a protected reproductive rights clinic uh and we're searching different states in which we could do that and uh we want to move into lobbying and model legislation and openly do that in the name of satanic lobby and i think a lot of people will think up front that there's no way we can make any headway but people thought that when we started doing anything we were doing and i think we're just going to keep pressing forward and not taking into account as we always have not the the way people respond when they hear satanist i mean we're just going to show them who we are by what we do and they can accept it or reject it ,1
544,[Music] [Applause]  well thank you very much it's a great pleasure to be here in this massive hall I can't believe that all of you decided that coming to talk about the topics we're going to talk about tonight was the top priority in your life but but let's see if we can justify that you know that might be a good that might be a good aim see if we could make it worthwhile so make your decision correct so you may know or not that I was on a television show last night Q&A apparently you know that some of you anyways I can't say I enjoyed it really really it's funny you know like I think as I've got farther along in doing whatever it is that I happen to be doing I find those events more and more stressful I don't know exactly what it is I think it's the proclivity of everything everything has to be mangled in some sense into a preset format you know and and the fundamental format really is that everything has to be political you know and everything isn't political so that's not helpful when you're trying to discuss things that aren't political and I mean I'm not complaining about it well I suppose I am  it's just it's it's surprising to me how how how how much it how much it takes out of me say compared to doing an event like this which I really enjoy doing like I spent a lot of time preparing and there's a lot of you and I really want it to go well and all that but this is this is much less dreadful haha I guess that's right and you know and then there's the strange constraints on format you know people ask very complex questions and and then you have a minute to answer and you know there's something there's something downright sinful about answering a really complicated question in a minute because it sort of suggests that complex questions have answers that take one minute and they don't they have answers that take God sometimes they take decades sometimes they take thousands of years you know but of course I can't expect a television show to allow for a thousands of years but but the format itself works against the kind of thought that's necessary to actually have discussions that are necessary and so anyways having said all that it went it went oh it went all right I would say there were no nasty surprises and particularly and it was a civil discussion whether it was a productive discussion or not is a different matter but it wasn't an unproductive discussion and so that's something but there was one question that came up and I thought I would actually start talking about that question tonight because I've never been happy I've been asked this question a lot and I've never been happy with the answer that I've given to it and I've never really been able to exactly get my I've never been able to figure out exactly why I haven't been happy with the question and so I'm gonna try to answer it properly tonight and then I'm going to talk more generally about 12 rules about the book now it's fine this question is directly relevant to the book and so it should make for a good lead-in but it'll enable us to talk about something that I think is really very much worth talking about and I hope I can formulate the problem properly and then formulate the proper sir at least more coherently than I've managed its see I have I have this I followed this rule for a very long time which I actually found was a Socratic rule I didn't know this until really quite recently until I wrote 12 rules for life Socrates said that he had a daemon and by which he meant an internal voice and he said that at all he always listened to it and then that was what made him different from other people that he always listened to this voice and the voice didn't tell him what to do he told him what not to do and when the Delphic Oracle proclaimed that Socrates was the wisest man in Greece in Athens and in Greece one of the reasons Socrates attributed her decision to deem him the wisest man was because while she said he knew he knew nothing but he knew in part that he knew nothing at least in part because he was always listening to the voice of his Damon his internal conscience and then I just found out the other day that the word democracy comes from the same root which is really interesting like I had no idea that that was the case because what it suggests it's it's it's it's so fascinating looking at how words are related to one another historically because you find strange connections between ideas that you would never imagine and sometimes they're unbelievably profound and so the basic what happened historically is that well so there was a concept of the Socratic Damon now it was the Damon that Socrates listened to when he decided that he was not going to run when the Athenians decided that they were going to put him to death the Athenian aristocrats right because they thought that he was corrupting the youth by you know talking to them and telling them the truth and I suppose that's certainly grounds for chasing someone out of your town anyways they gave him plenty of notice because they didn't really want to kill him they just wanted to get the old goat the hell out to some other city where he could cause trouble there and his friends were you know making plans to get to scurry him away from Athens and he went out consulted his Damon and it told him not to leave and that was a big shark to Socrates because of course he didn't want to die and but yet he had decided that he was always going to follow the dictates of the damon and he so he did something that only a philosopher would do was reversed his assumptions he thought oh well I was afraid of dying and my Damon said stick around and so I must be wrong it must be worse to be to risk not following that internal voice than to risk this form of death you know which is question you have to really wrestle with and when his friend when his friends weren't very happy about but in any case he didn't run and we have two good court like documents attesting to that one written by someone named Xenophon and the other by Plato they're very interesting documents I would highly recommend reading them they're very short and the reason one of the reasons I would recommend reading them apart from the fact that they're fascinating and and short is that you also get the sense from from what Socrates wrote that because he had lived his life fully you know no holds barred in some sense that he could let it go when the time came and and that's an interesting thing you know because well it's a question I think that we all wrestle with we should is like well is there a purpose to our life and well that's a hard question and then if there is a purpose well how is it expressed and then if there is a purpose and our lives are truncated as they are by death then how can that purpose have significance and those are hard questions but Socrates experience seemed to be that he had lived enough in his life so that when push came to shove which it certainly did he was able to gracefully let it go and that's  and you know he attested to that with his death and and and that's fairly convincing you know I mean that's a fairly convincing argument and it's one that I find well it's hard to tell if I find it exactly credible but I don't find it incredible I mean I certainly have noticed that as I've got older and I've done things various what would you say accomplished isn't exactly the right word I've participated in many things that I'm pleased to have participated in them but wouldn't necessarily go back and participate in them again it's sort of as if when you do something and you finish it it's as if it's done you don't have to do it again and maybe it's possible who knows that if you finish your life whatever that might mean if you exhaust your life then then that's enough life you know that you've had enough and I mean that doesn't mean that I try not to keep myself healthy and that I want to die tomorrow it doesn't mean any of that I'm trying to stick around as long as I can but but but there's still that that that curiosity about the relationship between life and mortality and and the possibility that a life well-lived exhausts itself in some fundamental sense so that you can be satisfied let's say with with what you with what you were there is some psychological evidence that bears on this if you ask people what they regret especially as they get older what they generally port is things not done so they don't regret so much mistakes they've made although of course people obviously regret mistakes they've made as well so they don't exactly regret sins of commission right errors that they've actively made they they miss they they torment themselves for opportunities that had presented themselves that they did not let's say exploit or engage in and I think that's worth thinking about too because one thing that I have become convinced about with regards to human consciousness which i think is equivalent to the spark of divinity in some sense that our fundamental stories insists as being placed within us is that human consciousness is that faculty that confronts potential itself I think there's good neurological evidence for this by the way for those of you who are scientifically minded because we build circuits within us for habitual action that we've practiced many times that seem to run in a very deterministic fashion and we are a strange combination of deterministic and non-deterministic as far as I can tell but what our consciousness seems to be for is to encounter those things that we have not yet encountered and those things that we have not yet encountered seem to me to be those things that have not yet been brought into being and so you could say that what our consciousness is for is for the encounter with potential you know that our consciousness is further it's not for the past it's not even for the present it's to transform the future into the present and and really that that's what our consciousness does when you wake up in the morning you have a new day ahead of you and the day could take you in very many directions and and the weeks and the years all of that can take you in very many directions and you have some apprehension about what those directions might be you have some apprehension about what role your choices might make in transforming that potential into one form of actuality or another I mean you certainly know that there are dreadful mistakes that you might be very tempted to make that would produce all manner of Hell around you and still be tempted to do it it seems like it's sitting there right in front of you as a possibility you also know that you know you could haul yourself up out of bed and attend to your duties and do the sorts of things that you're supposed to a few things right that day and that weekend that likely things would at least not be worse and they would probably be better and I believe that I do believe that I don't understand how this can be the case I don't understand how it is that consciousness consciousness can function in that way because I think to understand that we would have to understand what it means for the future to be only potential rather than actuality and who the hell understands that I mean no one and then we'd have to understand how it is that our conscious choices and our conscious ethical choices transform that potentiality into actuality into reality into the present in the past and we certainly but we certainly act as if we believe that that's what we do we upgrade ourselves for example when we do a bad job of it we're upset with our children and those we love if we don't believe that they're living up to their potential we're guilty and ashamed when we make choices that we feel are inappropriate we understand to some degree that the manner in which time lays itself out has something to do with the ethics of our choice and again I would say that's a very deep idea I think it's a I think it's I think it's the most true idea I know that's very emphasized that idea emphasized in ancient religious stories such as those that are outlined in Genesis or in Genesis with it's strange insistence that you know God is that which brings order out of chaos formless potential generates the world out of formless potential and that were somehow made in that image which which seems to me to be the case and at the proper way by the way to go about acting in that image is to act in relationship to the potential that confronts you with truth and with courage with careful articulation that's the logos and that if you do that then what you bring forth is is good so it those are all background ideas that are associated with 12 rules for life and they have a bearing on this question that I want to answer tonight and so I'm going to sit I have some notes which I don't usually use about I'm gonna use them tonight because I haven't got everything about this particular notion memorized in some sense yet because I'm still working it out but that should work out okay so we'll see we'll see what happens  so yeah yeah well good so Windows work that's always good seeing I've seen it not work sometimes when Bill Gates demonstrates it and that's that's got to be very very embarrassing although I would say you know all things considered he seems to have done quite well all right so here's here's the question that came up last night and this is a strange question for what is essentially a political show near the end a gentleman on videotape came up and and he discussed the topic of human dignity not it's not a topic you hear a lot about there's a lot of topics that are sort of related to human beings that you don't hear a lot about anymore you don't hear a lot about nobility you don't hear a lot about endurance let's say stalwart Ness courage dignity those aren't values that we discuss much responsibility being another one which is one I'm quite thrilled about all things considered because I think it's the pathway to meaning itself but so hit his was the topic of human dignity and he asked us a question do you believe in God and then he said as a Catholic I don't see any other way that we can have a universe with dignity and so I'm not so concerned about the second part of his commentary although I might get to that but the first part do you believe in God is a question that's been leveled at me many times and I'm going to come other people on the panel and I'm going to just review what they said briefly and then I'm going to talk about what I said and then I'm going to fix what I said I hope so that it's better at least that's the plan so Terry Butler who's was a laborer is a labor front bencher said I'm agnostic people are inherently valuable because they are people and no that doesn't work out very it's it's it's um it's one of those one-minute answers except it's actually only ten seconds because you can you can make the opposite argument and people do all the time you know like the Club of Rome for example which was an organization in Rome logically enough formed in the 60s it was very much concerned about the terribly detrimental effect that human beings were having on the planet and I believe it was one of the Club of Rome members who coined the idea and and if it wasn't it was someone who was thinking exactly the same way so works out either way that human beings were something approximating a cancer on the planet you know because of all the terrible things we were doing ecologically and so forth that was back when people believed we were going to over populate the planet to such a degree by the year 2000 that there would be widespread privation and starvation which by the way if you haven't noticed there isn't and and you know if you look at the terrible things that people do apart from the despoiling of the natural environment let's say there's all the you know malevolence that's associated with human interactions and also human social systems and it isn't so obvious as a consequence of that that you can make a straightforward case that human beings are inherently valuable merely because they're human beings because you can eat make an equally logical case from first principles that they're inherently well destructive or that they should be perhaps limited in their ability to procreate or that they are a catastrophe for the planet as a whole or that our entire history is nothing but a sequence of on what would you call unrequited malevolence and that people generally can't be trusted and so I don't find that answer particularly satisfying I think it's a it's a it's it's just self referential people are inherently valuable because they're people it's like well you don't really get anywhere with an answer like that so so she's agnostic and and then and but then she has this idea despite her agnosticism that you can make the case a priori with nothing but resummon heritable and seems to me that that requires a little more depth and a little more explanation for it to actually be convincing you know it's like it's not obvious to me that people themselves think that they're valuable all the time often they don't think that at all they don't certainly don't think that often when they're depressed they certainly don't think that when they're suicidal they don't really think that when they're ashamed or guilty or frustrated or disappointed or angry or waking up at 3:00 in the morning and tormenting themselves with their consciences they don't necessarily think that when they're fighting with their family or when they're upset at work or you know when things go wrong in life and so it's not so bloody obvious that people are inherently valuable and and then you might also notice that it's kind of easy to think that some people are more valuable than others sort of like an animal farm you know where the animals were all equal except that some animals were more equal than others but it's very easy for human beings to think that about other human beings because no matter where you look in human societies there are rank orders of value right in in any hierarchy that we produce that's associated with some ability we find that some people are so much better at whatever it is that they're doing that it's an absolute miracle and most people are absolutely dreadful at it and so you know if you were thinking about inherent value as something associated with something with with an approximation of skill or competence then it wouldn't be obvious from the structure of the world that people were inherently valuable in that manner either because there's such a rank order difference in our ability to do things you know and you might say well that kind of averages out across things but I don't think that's a very strong argument either so so it's not it's bloody well not obvious I'll tell you it's not obvious where this idea that people are inherently valuable came from that's a tough one you know an end and in and in and in aristocratic states or or tyrannical states it's certainly not obvious at all that there's any acceptance of the notion that people are inherently valuable it's like there's no necessary presumption of innocence for example and you don't have any sovereign right to your own destiny like you're not granted the rights not granted because that's the wrong way of thinking about it your rights as a sovereign individual who has the responsibility and the capability to determine the destiny of the state itself don't exist that doesn't exist as a concept and so I don't see that there's anything there that speaks of inherent value either so it's by no means an obvious concept in fact I think it's one of the least obvious concepts that human beings have ever come up with that each of us in some strange manner is is is to be attributed some divine spark let's say that makes us equal in some fundamental way before God you know before the reality of the universe itself even in relationship to our own laws I mean if you want a miracle for an idea that's that's I can't think of one that's that's more unlikely than that so I've been puzzling over that for a very long time because I cannot understand why in the world that idea ever came to be or how in the world we ever agreed to act as if it was true it's really something and we should let that go with we let that idea go to our great peril it's a fundamental remarkable fundamental idea and what's so interesting about it too is that once you have that idea weird as it is and improbable as it is and you start to organize your social relationships in accordance with it well then they work you know so my rule two is treat yourself as if you're someone responsible for helping and it's sort of predicated on the idea that regardless of your inadequacies and your malevolence which you know I'm sure you have many inadequacies and no shortage of malevolence just like everyone else regardless of that you have a moral obligation so that would be a responsibility to assume that despite all evidence that there's actually something of intrinsic worth about you and that as a consequence you're duty-bound to treat yourself like that is true and then it turns out that if you do that well then your life gets better and and I don't mean happier exactly although I would say it gets happier I mean it gets richer and more meaningful and deeper and and more worthwhile and and you become more educated and you become wiser and and and you treat yourself with more respect and you're a better model for other people and you're a better father or a better sister or better mother whatever it happens to be it's and you're less ridden by that guilt that that gnaws at you and shame that's there otherwise saying you're not what you could be you're not what you could be and that's a hell of a voice to get rid of and it's certainly not one that's easy to ignore so that's a pretty good that that idea that there's something divine let's say that resides within you of ultimate worth even as a philosophical statement or a psychological statement rather than a metaphysical statement it seems to be a precondition for establishing properly harmonious relationships with yourself and that's that's man that's we're thinking about a lot you know that you have because you think you couldn't think that in some sense you just own yourself you know because people do kind of make that claim especially when they're trying to justify for example their right to suicide but you know it's your life it's your body you're yours to do what you will with and if that was true well then it would seem to me that life would be a lot more straightforward because you would just tell yourself things that you would instantly obey and believe so first of all you tell yourself all the things that you were going to do and then you just run off and do them which you don't or obviously because it's much more difficult at that and then you'd also say well enough of the guilt and the shame and the negative emotion and the disillusionment and the vengefulness and all those things that make life hard has spread the self-recrimination it's like what the hell do we need that for and if we're our masters of our own destiny and owners of our own fate and why can't we just command to ourselves that that be dispensed with and like that doesn't work I've never seen anybody able to do that so I mean you can fool yourself for very brief periods of time into thinking that that might work but but it doesn't work and that's strange begin that this is one of the reasons I love the psychoanalyst say because they were really the people apart from the religious types who figured out that whatever you are you're not a unitary spirit that's under your own Dominion you know you're something like a loose unity of a multiplicity of spirits many of which are doing their own thing which you're striving to bring into some form of unity but even that unity isn't something that's under your control in any real sense it's it's a unity that has its own nature that you have to exist in relationship to and I would also say that that's one of the things that keeps people people's feet firmly on the ground because otherwise you it's easy to become egotistical and narcissistic you know if you if you think that you're the center of your own being you know in some fundamental sense then you're only what you're only beholding to yourself you're sort of a self created creature perhaps you could think about it that way but it doesn't work like that it's like the ideal that constitutes the unity that you might become then sort of manifests itself as something that you could strive toward but aren't and it it it also serves as a judge it's the thing that keeps you up at night saying you know there's some things you're just not attending to and you should get at it because life is short and there's no shortage of trouble that you might end up in and a wise person would attend to the dictates of conscience and and lay out his actions in the world according to what he knows to be true and correct and that is how people think and it isn't obvious that we why we think that way that this is part of the reason that it seems to me so obvious that we have a religious instinct because I can't think of what else you would possibly call that other than a religious instinct you know Nietzsche when he proclaimed the death of God which which by the way was no triumphant Proclamation because he also mentioned that we would never find enough water to wash away the blood which was his what would you call it prognostication for the 20th century and a very accurate one at that he believed that we would in some sense have to become as gods you know in ourselves in order to replace what we had lost he thought that that the collapse of the judeo-christian structure would be absolutely catastrophic for the West and I believe that he was correct and that the way out of that would be that we would have to create our own values we'd have to take the place of what was once let's say externalized and divine on to ourselves and you know it's a hell of a theory and and it's not and Nietzsche is not an easy person to criticize because you you have to do a lot of reading before you find someone who's 1/10 as smart as Nietzsche he has this funny line about his books it's really quite comical he said takes most writers a whole book to write what I can write in a sentence then he said no they can't even manage it in a book and that's actually true I mean if you read Nietzsche be one good and evil for example you see that that that his his thought is so powerful that it's really it's it's it's really a kind of miracle what what the psychoanalyst realized though this was particularly Jung's contribution I would say Carl Jung's contribution he was a great student of Nietzsche a real admirer of Nietzsche and really someone who is trying to solve the problem that need she had put forward which was well our underlying metaphysics our religious structure had collapsed and that was the story upon which our until entire culture was based for better or worse it had collapsed and we needed to do something about that and we were doing various things we were turning to fascism let's say or we were turning to communism both ideological replacements for more fundamental religious beliefs but that Nietzsche's suggestion that we turn to ourselves to extract out our own values to create our own values let me let me be more accurate about that happened to be untrue because we weren't the sort of creatures who were actually capable of doing that and that's a it's such what's one of the reasons I love Jung and his is biological take in some sense towards human beings because you know firmly believed and I think all of the evidence supports him believed that human beings actually had a nature you know that that we that we weren't merely social constructions which we certainly aren't despite what the social constructionist insist upon forcing us to think increasingly through legislative means and that we had to wrestle with what it was that we were you know even though we're we're our own creatures in some sense we also have to wrestle with our intrinsic nature and and we know about we know that about the nature part of that more and more I mean we know more about our neural circuitry for example we know that there's a circuit for rage and there's a circuit for fear and there's a there's a biological system for jealousy and there's a system for altruism and there's a circuit for play and there's another one for pleasure and there's a complex circuit for negative emotion pain and anxiety and frustration and disappointment guilt and shame and we know that human beings share that motivational structure not only with all other human beings but with certainly with all mammals and almost all animals and so that bile of a biological component of us is unbelievably right it's its mill tens of millions hundreds of millions and even and even billions of years old I read an interesting paper just the other day you know I tend to talk about lobsters more than the average person and one of the points I made in twelve rules for life was that our neural chemistry at least some of it is so similar it's been conserved so completely throughout the immense duration of evolution hundreds of millions of years that lobsters like human beings appear to become the lobster equivalent of depressed if they suffer a hierarchy defeat and that if you give them chemicals that are roughly analogous to human antidepressants it perks them right back up their posture improves and they'll go off and fight and you know when I first discovered that it just well it just it just blew me away I never recovered from it I thought my god really that the continent is 350 million years of continuity in in in the structure of those systems and you know we know the serotonin system which is the system I'm talking about does govern your observation of where you sit in a social hierarchy like it does for many many animal species and as one consequence of that regulates your emotion so that if it sees that you're a relatively high status creature in your local environment then it tends to allow you to feel more positive emotion and less negative emotion and if it sees you as a low status creature in your local comparative environment that it does the opposite it overwhelms you with negative emotion and suppresses positive emotion and so you know and that's really bad no one likes that it's it's it's fundamentally there's really nothing worse that can happen to you than that to have those emotions re re adjusted in that manner so that the incentive reward and the motivation and the positive emotion vanishes from your life so there's nothing to be enthusiastic or excited about and all of the negative emotions pain disappointment frustration grief all of those terrible negative emotions are Mendeley magnified no one wants that it's the it's the last thing you want perhaps it's the last thing you want and you know that's partly why people are very let's call it what would you say they're tightly they're willing to fight for their position in their status hierarchy and even for the existence of the hierarchies themselves so anyways it is the case that human beings have a nature and and we have to contend with that nature and so we can't just create our own values and and what what young especially you Freud started it but especially you believed that well in some sense what had happened was that we had lost the externalized religious narrative that had been projected by our imagination out onto the world you know you think about the the constellations and and and the names of the constellations and the idea that the skies were populated by gods you know that was an externalization of our imagination right projected out into the world we were seeing the world through our imagination and which is exactly how we do see the world and as we proceed we're better able to distinguish let's say what's imagination from what subjective world but that doesn't mean the imagination disappears or that it's without value because the imagination is part of what helps us let's say confront the future because we do that with our imagination and to compose things in impossibility before we realize them in actuality so for young the world of gods just collapsed within back into the imagination and it was into the imagination that we had to go again to discover what we had lost to discover these these lost values and that's akin in some sense I suppose to rescuing your father from the belly of the whale a very brilliant brilliant toward of intellectual tour-de-force to to manage that supposition especially back when back when he did it and I think I see no evidence whatsoever that he was wrong given as I said our radical inability to command ourselves as we are our own in some fundamental way we seem subject to now I'm we seem subject to intractable moral laws and I'm not trying to make a case for the accuracy of those laws necessarily or for their metaphysical origin but I am trying to make a case for their psychological and phenomenological reality you definitely experience them in so far as you suffer let's say that from from them from them pricks and arrows of your own conscience and I doubt if there's a single person in this room who doesn't regularly suffer in that manner and some of you suffer like that virtually all the time when you know which can also be a problem in any case you know it's it's it's interesting to note that we're not exactly masters in our own houses and that's that's how such a interesting thing to note because you think well if we're not masters in our own houses well what is it is it just is it just a chaotic internal structure is it merely the voice of nature and nature's various instinctual subsystems that doesn't seem to be correct because we do integrate them into something approximating a unity there's more than just the basics of nature we have language we have communication we have culture we build up above nature something that's more than nature but we're still beholden to it the question is well what are we beholden to what is this that we're beholding to and socially politically and individually that we cannot escape from well so that's part of the question do you believe in God well this part of the answer actually and you know it's no bleak answer but the first thing I'm trying to say is try controlling yourself try acting as if you're the fundamental source of your own values independent of any what would you call a transcendent ethical structure to see if you can do that but try it for a week try it for a month I've never met anybody that could do it now not even for a moment I mean I don't know how many of you have read Dostoyevsky and punishment but I would highly recommend that if you're interested in this sort of thing because it's the definitive study of this idea because in crime and punishment the protagonist commits the perfect murder and he has his reasons for it and more and many reasons because dusty husky didn't mess around when he wanted to give someone reasons he gave them reasons and Raskolnikov the main character had reasons for murder and then he commits his murder and he gets away with it but things don't go well for a Skolnick off because one of the things he finds out is that the risk alna carve that you were before you committed the murder is not the same as the risk all in the club as you are after you've committed the murder and there's a dividing line there that you don't it's like the red pill I guess right it's like it that's the matrix correct the red pill and once there's certain actions once you take them there's no going back and so that's what crime and punishment is about and risk Olenick off tortures himself to death well not literally but metaphysically psychologically because he cannot tolerate breaking the great moral code and so it's what's a great book it's truly a great book and and it's also extraordinarily like it's a it's a it's a it's a murder mystery thriller as well as being a deep philosophical book so if you're in the mood for you know a murder mystery thriller that's also a deep philosophical book then that's the one for you so now one of the other speakers on the panel van Badham who who who described was described not by me as a writer activist and Twitter Queen which is I think like being the Red Queen in in Ellis in Wunderland something like that I went on her Twitter site today to find out how many followers she has but apparently I'm not one of them because I'm blocked and it kind of surprises me because I didn't know that I'd ever tried to follow her but anyways she said and this was interesting she said I'm a Christian and a Marxist and I thought no you can only be a Christian and a Marxist if you well there's a couple of ways one is one is that you just want to be all things that are good at once regardless of their internal contradictions and so that would be one reason and another reason would be that you don't know anything about Christianity or Marxism and and and then the next would be that you're just compartmentalized you know like there's this idea that people can't hold 2 contradictory thoughts in their mind at the same time well that idea was formulated by someone who who's never met a human being because you can hold like 50 contradictory thoughts in your head at the same time as you know whenever you argue with someone that you love because you love them and maybe you even like them but you also hate them and you wish that you could just crush them right there and then and so like that's a lot of contradictory ideas and that's probably only like half the contradictory ideas that are running through your mind at the moment you know so man you're so full of contradictions that it's just beyond belief and the only time I mean I know this because I read undergraduate essays and what's what's interesting about undergraduate essays is it's so interesting because the undergraduate will make a claim in paragraph one and then in paragraph seven will make the opposite claim and they won't notice that they're intellectually and commensurate and you know that might happen 30 times in the essay and and the reason that that that works is because well they haven't been called on paradoxes but also because they haven't had to live the paradoxes through because you the only straight note you thought when you have like impulse a and impulse B and they conflict at the same time right and you can either do one or the other but not both you know if it's a today and B tomorrow well then you can be you can hold those ideas simultaneously but if it's a or B right now then you have to decide is a more important or is B more important you have to put them in a hierarchy and then you have to act them out and you have to see what happens and so then you find out if you're full of contradictions and part of the way that you iron out your contradictions which is very very hard to do is that you Walt and you do a whole bunch of things in the world like Socrates did you go you have your adventure in the world and you put your ideas to the test and those that work out in a paradoxical or counterproductive manner you dispense with or put lower on the priority list or something like that and that's how you discover that you know you can't hold in commensurate views simultaneously Carl Jung said that something like paradoxical views that are not made conscious will be played out in the world as fate and that's really worth thinking about too so if you have your let's call it your typical negative experience you know this thing that just keeps seems to just keep happening to you bad luck let's call it it's highly probable that there's a set of ideas that are occupying you preoccupying you possessing you that are driving you in this direction continually and that you you can't or won't work out the contradiction and as a consequence you know maybe you think every woman is your mother and you haven't noticed that you think that and that that you know and it is something that people think because women are mothers are women and it's not a bad initial template but you know you gotta you gotta modify it to some degree and you know if that's an unconscious idea that you have and you continue to play it out you may run into your continual habitual negative experience with women and you wonder what the hell is wrong with women but there it isn't the women that has the problem it's you and and you know if you run into problems with women all the time then it's highly probable that the problem is you so not always but generally so let's go into this Marxist and Christian idea here just for a minute so Oh we'll start with let's start with some of the ideas of Marx well Marx believed that people were basically socially constructed so that we were blank slates and that whatever our nature was was given to us essentially by our surroundings but even more importantly by our social class right because Marx was a theorist of social class and believed that the primary dispute let's say the primary motivator of human history the primary driver of human history was something like the rich versus the poor the Mersey versus the proletariat and that was a consequence of your social upbringing and that your group identity was paramount okay so there's nothing about that it's vaguely Christian that's not how the Christian worldview works know how the judeo-christian worldview works because in that world you you're fundamentally an individual your nature is fundamentally attributable to you by God you're fundamentally responsible to God and your and and history itself is something like the playing out of your relationship to the transcendent so those things aren't even those aren't the same they're not commensurate you can't believe both of them at the same time Marxism is a materialistic philosophy it's predicated on the idea that essentially an idea that Dostoyevsky criticized in great depth was that if you just made people rich enough let's say if you deprived them of their privation if you equalize their economic status let's say that the Utopia would come to light upon earth and you know I I have a certain amount of sympathy for a view point like that because you know who likes starvation and and misery you know there's nothing positive to be said about that but I think Dostoyevsky was right too in his criticism of Marxism although he wasn't directly aiming this at Marx in notes from underground where he noted that you know if you gave people what they wanted in terms of let's say bread and circuses they had as he said nothing to do but eat cakes and busy themselves with the continuation of the species which is kind of a nice phrase that the first thing they would do is take a hammer and smash things just so that something improbable and strange would happen just so that we could have our way you know and it's kind of a recapitulation of the idea of original sin in in Dostoyevsky subtle manner is that were the sorts of creatures that you know what did he say we're ungrateful that's the thing that primarily distinguishes us from animals is we're ungrateful and that we can curse that was what he thought made us different than animals and that if even if we got what we wanted materially that wouldn't satisfy us because we're not the sorts of creatures that can be satisfied with material possessions let's err material comfort because it isn't even obvious that we're after comfort I mean what do you want you want you want to just lay in a feather bed and eat peeled grapes all day I mean maybe for an hour or so that might not be a bad idea but you know it's gonna get dull pretty quick you're gonna go out looking for trouble and and it's certainly possible that the more material resources and the easier they were to get that you have at your disposal the more creative ways you're going to find to cause yourself trouble when you go out and look for trouble and so and that's a testament to the human spirit and Dostoevsky knew this is like well whatever we're here for it isn't the Utopia of equal material distribution that that's not we're not we're not we're not looking to be fed and asleep you know and I don't know what it is that we're looking for god only knows maybe what we're looking for is to continually keep looking something like that I mean that's the sorts of creatures that we are but but the but the materialist philosophy is that well if you just prove I did for people economically problem over and no wrong I mean most of you are as given that you're you know you're going to be ill in one way or another and that you're still subject to mortality and and all of the terrible natural limitations that human beings are characterized by your mode is well off as you're gonna get you know the economic data already show that once you have enough money so that bill collectors aren't chasing you which basically puts you say at the kind of in the upper reaches of the working class or maybe the lower end of the middle class something like that that additional money has absolutely no effect whatsoever on your self-reported well-being which is something like a combination of positive emotion and absence of negative emotion so you might like to think that you know if you were rich your life would be better and maybe it would be somewhat better but it wouldn't be as much better as you might hope and that's because you'd still have most of the problems that people have you know you still maybe wouldn't get along with your sister and you'd still get divorced and maybe you'd even be more likely to and there'd still be illness as that would be set you you'd be able to deal with them perhaps with some degree a more urgency but and you'd still have the problem with what the hell your life is for and what you're doing on the planet and how to conduct yourself in the proper way and so so we don't want to be too naive about materialism even though we don't want to be ungrateful for its advantages Marx also believed while I said this already that you know history was basically characterized by the war of socioeconomic groups that's being transformed more recently into the war of identity groups which is the same damn thing and it's the same old wolf in new sheep's clothing as far as I'm concerned that you know the best way to conceptualize human beings is well I don't know whatever your damn identity is maybe it's sex for you and it's ethnicity for you and it's gender for you and god only knows what it is for you and you know and that's who you identify with and all there is in the world and this is the post modernist view is hierarchies of people in these identity groups struggling for Dominion you know and that's a quasi Marxist viewpoint it's just a variant of the bourgeoisie versus proletariat theory of history which is a foolish theory as far as I'm concerned and certainly not one that we need to take forward into the 21st century although we seem you know destined to insist that we do so he believed that the revolutionary overthrow of the oppressor class was necessary and morally demanded and that turns out to be a little bloodier than I would say the typical Christian judeo-christian ethic might require because it doesn't require you to take up arms against your evil overlords and well put them in goo legs and kill them by the millions for example and that to me seems to be an important difference there's there's no in in the judeo-christian tradition there's no guilt there's no group guilt right you're guilty and you're guilty of different things right I presume and and that's your problem but maybe you're also innocent who knows you know but whatever it's on you it's not a consequence of your racial heritage or your ethnicity or your gender any of those things it's it's between you and God let's eres between you and the state even but at least it's between you and the state or God it's not like well you know your father was a factory owner let's say your grandfather and so it was perfectly reasonable during the Russian Revolution and the Red Terror to vacuum you up along with your whole family and do away with you because you'd be the irredeemably tainted by your burgeois z past so that's another place where Marxism and judeo-christianity are then they're not just different like they're opposite you know it's not just variant one invariant - these are like seriously different ideas and so there's another reason you can't be a Marxist in a Christian as if you and then there's the idea that you know that marks had that religion was the opiate of the masses which doesn't exactly sound like I've always thought religion was the opiate of the masses but communism Marxism was the methamphetamine of the of the masses let's say yeah the meth of the masses we we had no idea with regards to opiates so here's what Marx has to say about religion the abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for the real happiness to call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions it's interesting to me because it's not like the judeo-christian story was really a happy one as far as far as I can tell you know I mean there was heaven but Genesis II you were gonna get in man that was low and and and mostly it was a fair bit of original sin you know and a fair bit of you wrestling with all of your inadequacies and your proclivity towards malevolence to pick up your cross to bear your suffering to understand that you know there is a war in your soul between the forces of good and evil it's like how that's an opiate is beyond me I mean if I was going to design an opiate that made people feel better I'd certainly dispense with a fair bit of that it's like whatever you do is okay we could start with that there's certainly no hell that's something we're gonna get rid of right away little less guilt and shame would be it could be like a hippie cult in the 1960s you know with a little more marijuana and some free sex something something like that so I don't really understand the illusion idea there is Marxist criticism I suppose of the belief of you know the great the Great Father in the sky hoo-hoo-hoo still doesn't seem to me to be that like he's sort of still kind of a nightmarish creature all things considered since at least in principle he's keeping track of everything you do even more than you are and that's not such a good thing but whatever so it's a foolish criticism as far as I can tell it doesn't matter he's still criticized it the criticism of religion is therefore in Brio the criticism of that veil of tears of which religion is the halo criticism meaning his has plucked the imaginary flowers on the chain not in order that man shall continue to bear that chain without fantasy or consolation but so that he shall throw off the chain and pluck the living flower that's something that plenty of Marxists did I can tell you the criticism of religion disillusions man so that he will think act and fashion his reality like a man who has discarded his illusions and regained his senses so that he will move around himself as his own true son s UN yeah well that's that's Marxism in a nutshell all right I mean that's like that's the fundamental definition of pathological merit narcissism so that he will move around himself as his own true son right religion is only the illusory son which revolves around man as long as he does not revolve around himself and you know generally we don't use that as an insult he only revolves around himself isn't that an insult and isn't this the reason for that don't we assume that there's something that you should be revolving around that isn't just yourself you know it's it's it's it could be many things you know it could be while someone you love that that would be a start could be a child could be your your partner in life it could be it could be your family in extension could be your community it could be some noble ideal that you're trying to serve should be something other than you as the primary center of the universe around which well you and presumably everything else revolves so I don't really see that as a particularly wise what would you call it philosophy and as it manifested itself in the world you know I would say Stalin probably revolved around himself quite nicely since and don't you think I mean if you had to pick someone who was revolving around himself it would be a pretty decent competition between Mao and Stalin and-and-and that didn't seem to be that didn't seem to be for the best so so that's something to consider as well the Marxists believed that religion hindered human development and the Soviets and the Maoists instituted state atheism apart from the worship of their leaders of course and then I'm gonna read you a poem by Marx this is a good one I found this a while back god it's a rough poem and you know you want it you want to let your imagination sort of I would say let your imagination loose with with this poem which is what you should do with the poem and imagine the sort of state of mind that you have to be in to write a poem like this and then also imagine as you should that poetry like dreams are the birth its birthplace of thought with my undergraduates often especially ones that are really obsessed with ideas they'll often put really bad poetry in their essays and and I'm not saying that in a in a cynical way because bad poetry can have good ideas in it it's it's hard to write good poetry you know but the thing is often an idea that's extraordinarily emotional in content will manifest itself as a poem before it is able to articulate itself out into a fully expressed philosophy and so I see this with my undergraduates they'll really be obsessed with something that's bothering them then the rights of some poem often about a personal experience and then as I help them shape the essay they kind of unfold the poem into an articulated statement about the structure of reality and so you could say well you know we're all embedded in the dream we know that you go to sleep every night and you dream you're embedded in your imagination if you're if you're forbidden to dream if you're deprived of your dreams you will lose your mind that's been experimentally demonstrated quite nicely on animals but also on human beings you have to dream you have to enter that that realm of incoherent imagination and possibility in order to maintain your sanity which is extraordinarily interesting and very strange and I would say poetry exists on the border between the dream and the fully articulate wakefulness it's it's it's it's it's the place where the image of the dream meets the meets the meets the meets the articulated speech full consciousness and so you can think about that with regards to this poem invocation of one in despair so a God has snatched from me all my all in the curse and rack of Destiny all his worlds are gone beyond recall nothing but revenge is left to me on my self revenge I'll proudly wreak on that being that enthroned Lord make my strength a patchwork of what's weak leave my better self without reward I shall build my throne high overhead cold tremendous shell its summit be for its bulwark superstitious dread for its Marshall blackest agony who looks upon it with a healthy I shall turn back struck deathly pale and dumb clutched by blind and chilled mortality may his happiness prepare its tomb and the Almighty's Lightning shall rebound from that massive Iron Giant if he brings my walls and towers down eternity shall raise them up defiant well I would say that's the sort of poem that would be written by someone who revolved around himself as his own true son and I would also say that given what we know about what happened as a consequence of the instantiation of Marxist doctrine that this is a truly horrifying piece of literature to contemplate written by the way when Marx was rather young so then the question came to me do I believe in God and I don't like that question and people have complained at me a lot and I'm sure they have the reasons because they don't like my answers you know and I have two answers they've kind of become stalk which is not a good thing but but they're the best approximate exactly I've got three I had three sort of burgeoning hypotheses one was it's none of your damn business that's the first one so it's like a privacy issue like it seemed to me to be a question that was too private to be answered properly and so and you know you could consider that a cop-out and maybe it is and then another one was well what do you mean by believe like do you mean the words do you mean to say the words I believe in God does that indicate that you believe in God like I don't know what you mean by believe exactly because and that's got me in trouble too because you know people think that attempting to clarify the meaning of words is an attempt to escape from the question when it's actually an attempt to specify the question I mean is what you believe what you say or what you act out now you know I would say to some degree it's both but if push comes to shove as far as I'm concerned what you believe is what you act out not what you say and then you know and if you're an integrated person then what you act out and what you say are the same thing and then you're a person whose word can be trusted right because what you say and what you do are isomorphic they're the same thing but belief is instantiated in action so I have also suggested that I act as if I believe in God or to the best of my ability and people aren't very happy with that either but and then the third is that I'm afraid that he might exist which i think is the most comical of the three answers and perhaps the most accurate one but then but then I was thinking about this today when I was thinking about what I might talk to you guys about and I thought well let's go into this a little bit more let's say you say you do believe in God say I believe in God it's like okay well that's hypothetically pretty impressive I would say it's like you believe that there's a divine power that oversees everything that is fundamentally ethical that's watching everything you do and and you believe that and so what effect does that have on your behavior if you believe it does that mean that you're well are you --fill are you all-in on your beliefs are you sacrificing everything to this transcendent entity that you proclaim belief in have you cleansed yourself of all your sin let's say are you making all the sacrifices that you need to make like have you taken the mote out of your I know or or or or are you in the same situation let's say that the Catholic Church seems to be in right now just out of curiosity bring that up since the Pope seems to be concerned with what's been happening with the Catholic Church given the endless pedophilic scandals let's say which seem rather serious in my estimation and might have been something that was cleaned up perhaps a hundred or a thousand years ago and it's being taken seriously perhaps now and perhaps not because it's not so easy to determine exactly what it would mean to take that seriously and you might say well are all the people who are committing these highness actions and then covering them up or if you ask them well do you believe in God what are they going to say well you'd think the answer would be yes given that they're like priests and and yet and yet what's the evidence well the evidence isn't exactly so clear that the mere statement let's say or the mirror acting out of the ritual let's say and I'm not trying to denigrate the statement or the ritual but I'm pointing out that that's no indication of your right to say that you believe because you got it and I think this is why it's more than me to answer this question it's like what right do I have to say that to make that claim I believe in God well what's the claim is that the claim that I'm a good person somehow because you think that if you believed in God actually like like seriously that you'd be a good person like right now because well for obvious reasons I would think and so if that hasn't happened in some sort of miraculous sense so that you're the best person you could possibly imagine being on an ongoing basis and then terrified of of deviating from that path in a serious manner then I don't see why you have the right to say that you believe in God you know one of the things Nietzsche said about Christianity it was a great critic of Christianity although also a great friend in a very peculiar way in that sometimes your best friend is the one who points out your weakest properties let's say he said as far as he was concerned there was only one Christian and he died on the cross and and that's that's a you know perhaps an extreme statement but one worth giving some consideration to it's like well then you look at what if what are you called upon let's say if you're going to proclaim yourself as a believer you know and I thought about this a lot as I've gone through the Old Testament I did a bunch of lectures last year and so what do you called upon well you're called upon initially to act out the spark of divinity that's within you by confronting potential with the logos that's within you which means to take the opportunities that are in front of you the potential future and to transform it into the present in the best possible way using truth and courage and careful articulation as your as your as your as your as your guide so that's the first thing you're called on to do now that's a major deal there that's a tough one and then the second is to make the proper sacrifices that's the Cain and Abel story is like you you want something you genuinely want it you want to set the world straight than you let go of what's necessary and you pursue you let go of what isn't necessary no matter what it is no matter what it is and then you pursue what's necessary and then maybe you sacrifice your children to God that that was the story that's the one of the next stories that comes up of course and you think well that's pretty damn barbaric and the way the story's laid out of course it is but that isn't exactly what it means it means that what you try to do when you raise children is that you try to do everything you can to impress upon them by imitation and by instruction and by love and by encouragement that they are crucial beings in the world whose ethical decisions play an important role in shaping the structure of reality itself and that they have the moral responsibility to do that and you get your Ark in order that's your family let's say so that when the storms come you can stay above water for the 40 days of flooding and you're capable of leading your people through the desert when the desert makes itself manifest and you can escape from tyranny properly because you're wise enough to see it and you take the full burden of being on yourself all the suffering that's that's part and parcel of that you accept that voluntarily let's say and you do everything you can to confront the malevolence that's part of you and that's part of the state and it's part of the world and you you you make a garden around you that's the paradise a walled garden it's a walled well watered place so the forces of nature and society exist together in harmony and you place your family in that so that they can live properly and you treat your enemy as if he's yourself and the same with your brother and well then you can say then maybe you can say maybe then you have the right to say that you believe in God otherwise maybe you should think twice about it because you know there's a line in the New Testament that Christ Himself says two of them I should read them two because there are very relevant to this I guess I could pair of Frye's to paraphrase them a rich man comes up to Christ and says and and says good good leader good lord and he asked him a question about how it is that he should be a good person and Christ says don't call me good there's no one that's good but God and you know that's worth thinking about I mean the one person that in principle in our ancient stories had the right to make some direct connection between himself and the divine was unwilling to do it when challenged and so it might be reasonable to assume that each of us could be much more cautious about making that sort of statement bluntly when we're asked and then the other line is not all those who say Lord Lord will enter the kingdom of heaven got that about right which means something approximating just because you make a claim to moral virtue let's say your belief in God which I can't see how you can make a higher claim to moral virtue than that you know I mean agnostic atheistic I don't recap the purpose the point is something like this imagine something of ultimate transcendent value I don't care whether you believe in it or not but imagine that something like that exists and then you swear allegiance to it which is to say I believe in this I mean there's a heavy moral burden that comes along with that just to allow yourself to utter the words without feeling that you should be immediately struck down appropriately by lightning and so well and so I think that's why that question makes me uncomfortable it's that I don't think I have a I don't think I have a right to make that Proclamation there's another thing too that I learned when I was going through these biblical lectures it was a fascinating thing to do was the story of Jacob who became Israel and Jacob was a real you know he was a morally ambiguous figure to put it mildly and he tricked his older brother out of his birthright and he was full of tricks and he had a lot of tricks played on him too and maybe learned something as a consequence anyways after running away from his brother who had murderous thoughts and for good reasons for I liked about 20 years maybe it was only 14 but doesn't matter it was a long time he decided that he would go back and try to make peace and he came to this river he sent his family across the river along with his belongings um and and partly as an offering to his brother a peace offering and he had a dream dream visionary experience hallucination God who knows what it was and he dreamt that he wrestled with an angel all night and that the angel was God and God he won which is very strange because well first of all he was a trickster figure you know like he wasn't your most upstanding moral creature he wasn't Noah for example and second well it was God you know it's like figure to wrestle with someone and lose there's an opponent that's likely to take you out and he did damage his hip him so what not that impressive an accomplishment on thoughts pardon my estimation but but it's a very interesting story because what it does indicate what's so cool about it you see Jacobs name is changed at that point to Israel and Israel means those who wrestle with God and then that's so that blue meal is one of the things I love about studying old stories is now and then you come across a piece of one and you and you see in it into it you know you see down into the depths that that characterizes it's very difficult but happens sometimes and it just flattens you you know to think that if Israel is that is the chore if Israel is the chosen people of God that's the hypothesis and what Israel means is those who wrestle with God then think that that gives that seems to me to be such a hopeful idea because well everyone does that to some degree I mean you do that in your life because well you don't know what's a fundamental transcendent worth you know because who the hell are you and what do you know you know you're you're struggling all the time with well I would say with good and evil when you're struggling with yourself you're struggling with the world to to to portray that as wrestling with God that's perfectly reasonable from a metaphoric perspective and the idea that that's what characterizes the true people of God is that willingness to wrestle that's really something because it kind of indicates that you're here as a contender you know you're not here to be happy you're not here to be complacent you're not here to be materially satisfied not that that would be possible anyways but that you're here to contend with the structure of reality right and that's what'll satisfy you because there's something to you you know you're not weak and nothing there's something to you there's certainly something malevolent and terrible I mean you know that you look at how people behave you you look at the blood and catastrophe of our history you can certainly see though the absolute the absolute hellish depths of the human soul but there's there's something that takes root in that and grows up out of that it's absolutely magnificent beyond belief and that's looking for for to contend you know and I've often thought that I've been fortunate in my marriage because you think well you got you get married and you live happily ever after it's like  that's not it is it you don't want that either you know what you putting on it we want your partner to do just all she's gonna do is sprinkle rose petals in front of you right and pat you on the back of the head and tell you how wonderful you are constantly day after day man you'd be so sick of that after - well maybe take a month but but let's say two weeks it'd be you you'd be cuz you know she should be more on the side of who you could be than on the side of who you are and if she's deluded enough or terrified enough to worship you in your current form then well that doesn't say much for her and it certainly isn't very helpful for you you want someone that's gonna get in the way now and then you know and and to contend with and I've been fortunate in my marriage because I have someone to contend with you know we we have our our discussions and they're not easy involved but partly because we have hard problems to solve because life is full of hard problems I want someone who stand up you know and and have her say even if it's not what I would say and maybe I'm even willing at times because she's quite intuitive and a good dreamer and I'm more facile verbally and so we have to be careful in our relationship because if I'm in a particularly ornery mood and she has something to say I can usually slice up her arguments verbally you know and then that's that's fine as far as I'm concerned because I get to win but it's stupid well it's stupid it's first of all that doesn't mean I'm right it just means I can formulate verbal arguments slightly faster than she can but her intuitions and her dreams are often extraordinarily accurate and so we've learned to to some degree to buttress each other's arguments just on the off chance that the person that you were foolish enough to marriage marry might know something you don't now and then about something important you know  and so what do you want well you want someone to contend with and then it's an adventure you know and then you have someone that you love and that you respect and that's not a bad combination for longevity of relationship and then maybe if you have someone that you love and respect and that you can communicate with and your children also love and respect her or him and then that's pretty good for them because they've got some parents that they could love and respect that's a good combination you know it solidifies their life and so you want to contend with them and you want a job that's challenging I would say that pushes you beyond what you already are and god only knows how much how hard you need to be pushed in order to go beyond where you are but you know to some degree if you have a choice you know it's not that uncommon that what we'll do is choose to be pushed to the limit especially when we're at our best we think well where's the limit it's here maybe I can manage that I'm gonna push myself right to the damn limit then I'm gonna push myself a little bit over just to see if it's possible and and if that happens then you know you emerge with a sense of of triumph I'm now more than I was right and maybe that's what you're here to be is to be more than you were trying to push those limits and to do that you contend with the world you wrestle with God you don't casually say I believe because who knows no one no one knows right we're separated from the infinite by death and ignorance we don't know we contend we wrestle you know and in that maybe we find our destiny at least we find our purpose we find something that's that that justifies us to some degree you know if I'm awake at night wondering and I thank God you know like I've I pushed myself as far as I could in this effort whatever the effort that I'm considering happens to be I pushed myself I don't have a weight on my conscience because I let something go or I failed to accomplish some I mean I do often have those sorts of weights I'm talking about the rare times when I don't it's like well there's something that that that's where there's some atonement and some peace as far as I'm concerned where that contending and that wrestling has been successful and I would say that insofar as you're deeply involved in that like completely involved in that thoroughly involved in that then you have the right to say that you believe in God and since I'm not like that a hundred percent of the time or even approximating the percent of the time that I would like to be like that you know despite my best efforts then when people ask me I'm not going to say something virtuous like I'm a believer because there's plenty wrong with me that needs to be fixed before I would dare utter words like that thank you [Applause] well so that's better answer to that question so thank you very much for for walking through that with me let's say now you have all not all many of you have asked some questions tonight using this nifty little device called slide Oh which I really like and so now what I'm going to do is spend 20 minutes or so looking through the questions that you asked and seeing if I have anything that isn't completely incomprehensible and embarrassing to say about them so let's try that hmm well this is a strange one I don't know about you people from Sydney so uh it's from Kathy Newman  which strikes me as somewhat unlikely and it's got a hundred and sixty-four up votes so which is quite a few up votes it hurt when you destroyed me on ABC now I don't know if that's referring to last night or so many months ago but I have enrolled in university to get my facts right yeah well that probably won't work thank you for enlightening my soul the burns are still healing  yeah well that's it's not exactly a question it's it's it's four sentences that are quite the strange combination that I would say something about the burns are still healing you know I mean Nietzsche said that you could tell much about a man's character by how much truth he could tolerate which is very interesting you know there's not an idea in in in the in the great western tradition that the truth is the way and the path of life and and that no one comes to the Father except through the truth and and I believe that to be the case because I don't think that you can manifest who you are without the truth and so I think it's it's it's literally and metaphorically truth that the the pathway to who you could be if you were completely who you were is through the truth and I would say and so the truth does set you free but the problem is is that it destroys everything that isn't worthy in you as it sets you free and that's that's a process of burning and and and it's it's painful because you cling to what you shouldn't be partly out of pride and partly out of ignorance and partly out of laziness and and and so then you encounter something true and you all know this you all know this well because when was the last time that you learned something important that wasn't a blow of some sort you know it's often you look back at your life and you think oh god I really learned something there I wouldn't want to do that again but it really changed my life I mean sometimes it can really destroy you you know an encounter with the truth and you never really recover but now and then something comes along and straightens you out and a lot of you has to go a law to you has to burn away you know and and and I suppose in some sense the idea is that everything about you that isn't worthy is to be put into the flames and that's that's another reason to be not so casual about claiming what you believe because it isn't something that you undertake with oh do caution you know I learned when I was kid about 25 or so little older than a kid that almost everything that I said was one form of lie or another and I wasn't any worse I would say that the people that I was associating with or any better and and the lies were manifold you know they were attempts to win arguments for the sake of winning the argument that might be one attempts to indicate my intellectual prowess when there were competitions of that sort maybe just the the sheer pleasure of engaging in an intact intellectual argument and winning my inability to distinguish between ideas that I had read and and incorporated because I had read but had realized that I hadn't yet earned the right to use all of that and you know I had this experience that lasted a long time while I would say it's really never gone away that and I think this was the awakening of my conscience essentially and I didn't realize that this until much later when I was reading Socrates apology this this voice for lack of a better made itself manifest inside me and it said every time I said something that wasn't true and that's usually what it said that's not true you don't believe that or there was a sensation that was associated with it I don't think this is that uncommon you know I asked my psychology classes for many years in a row if they hadn't experienced this experience that they had a voice in their head let's say it's a metaphor or a feeling that communicated to them when they were about to do something wrong and it was universally the case that people agreed with one of those statements or another and the other thing I would ask is well do you always listen to it and of course the answer to that was definitely no but that's also very interesting you know that you can have this faculty this conscience this seems to to me to be very tightly associated with the idea of free will is that you can have this internal voice this Damon the root word for democracy oh yes I didn't finish that story so the yes well it's important well so Socrates Damon told him it was his moral guide and democracy appears to be predicated on the idea that the polity will function if people attend to their consciousness that's the that's the that's the overlap of those conceptualizations and that's that that's it well first of all I think that's the case you know and it makes a certain amount of logical sense I mean if we assume that the political state is something like the emergent consequence of the decisions of all its citizens we would assume that the wiser the decisions of the citizens the more upright and functional the state I can't see how it could be any other way and perhaps those who are the most upright who listen to their consciousness consciences more carefully even play a disproportionately powerful role it's certainly possible so anyways back to truth well you know I learned that so much of what I was doing was false and I think I learned this CIA there was a reason that this came to me so clearly I was trying to understand why people did terrible things and I was really concentrating on the terrible terrible things that people do and I was interested in Auschwitz for example and Nora now known as a political phenomenon but as a as a psychological phenomena I was curious about how you could be a nosh wits guard and I wasn't really curious about how you could be one because well you could be whatnot of course I was more curious about how I could be one being such a good person as I thought I was and but I also knew that people many people did many terrible things during the 20th century and the idea that I was somehow better than them or that I should assume a priori that I was better than them and that I wouldn't have made the same choices or worse had I been in the same situation was a very very very dangerous supposition and in fact a sufficiently dangerous supposition to bring about the very danger that I assumed was worth avoiding I had this idea you know that what had happened especially in Nazi Germany but also in in the Soviet Union shouldn't happen again that what we needed to do because of what happened in the 20th century especially because we also managed to create hydrogen bombs that it was in that and that we had become so technologically powerful that it would there wasn't time for that anymore that time for that was over and that we really needed to understand why it happened and that perhaps we could go deep enough in that understanding which is I think what happens when you go deep and understanding so that you could stop it because if you if you understand the problem maybe you can solve it you know and and at least in part I came to believe that the problem was as Solzhenitsyn said that the problem is is that the line between good and evil runs down every human heart and I'd was reading young at the same time you know and he believed that the human soul was a tree whose roots grew all the way to hell and believed also that in the full investigation of the shadow which was the dark side of the human psyche was that it was bottomless essentially that that that it was like an experience of Hell and that also struck me as true and that the way to stop those sorts of things from happening was to stop yourself from being the sort of person who would do it who would even start to do it because the other thing you learn when you learn about atrocities of that sort you could read ordinary men by the way which is an unbelievably great study of exactly this sort of phenomena it's on my book list on my website it's about a group of German policemen who were turned into brutal murderers over a period of months when they went behind when they went into Poland after the Germans had marched - and they were just ordinary middle-class men and they weren't forced into this by their leadership by the way either which was one of the things that makes the book so interesting so for me it was a matter of understanding that if we want this sort of thing to not happen anymore then we have to start to become the sort of people who wouldn't do it which seems rather self-evident all things considered unless you know you believe that were the pawns of social forces for example like the Marxists do and I don't believe that because we're also the creator of social forces and we're also capable of standing up to social forces because I would say the individual is more powerful than the social force all things considered interestingly enough that the way to stop such things - from happening the way to remember properly is to understand that that you could do it that you could do those terrible things because the people who did them were like you and that the way out of that is to stop being like that and the way you stop being like that is well at least in part by stop by ceasing to tell yourself lies that you don't believe in and that you know you shouldn't act out and you know and that's made a huge difference in my life for better for worse I mean it was very uncanny experience I would say because it's very discombobulating to experience yourself as fragmented enough so that much of what you do and say is actually false it's a lot of work to clean that up a lot but the consequences are in principle worthwhile and so that was part of what understanding that was part of what drove me towards clinical psychology saying away from political science and law and from politics in general because I started to believe that and I think this is the great Western idea which people were quite irritated about by the way on Q&A last night as well that the proper route forward for the redemption of the individual and for mankind as a whole is as a consequence of the redemption of each individual and I truly believe that and I believe that that occurs as a consequence of adherence to the truth and courage in the face of being that's rule one right to stand up straight with your shoulders back is to take on the onslaught and to enter the contentious ring and to do your to do and to do more than your best because your best isn't enough because your best isn't as good as you could be you have to push yourself past that and and that's as far as I can tell where you find what you need in life you find the meaning that sustains you in life and you find the patterns of action that redeem the world both at the same time I mean life is a very difficult business you know it's it's fatal and it's full of suffering and it's and it's full of betrayal and malevolence there's nothing about it that's trivial it's all profound and in order to find your way through all of that that that capacity for hellish experience let's say you need to develop a relationship with something that's profound and you can you have that capacity and what could be more profound than the truth and what would you rather have on your side and you might say well that's obvious and of course everyone should do that and then you need to know why you don't and the answer is well it sort of encapsulated in this first amusing question you don't thank you for enlightening my soul the burns are still healing it's like well you know there's no shortage of Deadwood to burn off and and there's no shortage of pain when the deadwood burns off and that's what makes people afraid of the truth you know maybe that's why Moses encountered God in the burning bush who the hell knows but there's something about that idea that seems to me to be the case and so what's the decision that you make you know you decide to believe you know it's a risk an existential risk it's an active faith you believe that the truth can set you free you believe that people have an intrinsic divinity about their soul you decide that you're going to live in that manner and that you're going to let everything about yourself that isn't worthy of that goal die and that might be almost every that you are and that's a terrible thing to contemplate the only thing that's worse I would say is the alternative because the alternative is the sorts of hell's that we managed to produce around us and that we produced with particular expertise during the totalitarian regimes of the 20th century and it would be a good thing if we decided collectively and individually not to go back there again thank you  you,1
86,"What do you tell people to do with their  money how to be aware of money and how  is money used in a similar way as a  psychological tool  money doesn't really exist it's a theory  if you look at how the world's  been acquired it's been done  by a banking scam where you lend people  money that doesn't exist we call it  credit and you charge them interest on it  and if they don't pay the money back  plus interest then you get their wealth  that does exist you get their home their  business their land their resources  whatever and we've been through a  process of banks  lending credit, figures on a screen  greatly in excess of what  they have as assets called fractional  reserve lending and then when they can't  pay it back because often the banks  have taken actions that have  crashed the economy like in 2008 the  banks then get all the things they've  lent money on the real wealth of the  world and what's happened in this  process of lending credit  getting the real resources when they  can't pay back the credit has sucked the  wealth of the world the real  wealth of the world into the hands of  a very very few people and left out  there most of the rest of the population  with something called money and money  only buys anything because we take it  seriously you know if it's just a piece  of paper and this is the point it's  meant not even to be a piece of paper it's  meant to be purely electronic and so we  have this fresh air money that is worth  something because the buyer and the  seller believe in it and only because of that  and the real wealth of the world  has been sucked into the hands of a very  few people by lending this scam called  credit another interesting thing about  it this money situation is when you go  to a bank and you say borrow 50,000 pounds  they'll type into your account  50,000 pounds in credit  where does the credit come from here  but you're not paying back 50,000 pounds  you're paying back 50,000 pounds plus interest  the interest is never created only the  principal because people think that  governments create money  money is overwhelmingly created  by private banks  issuing credit that's that's how  so-called money comes into circulation  so what this means is  creating credit for the principal but  not the interest is that at no point is  there ever enough money credit or  otherwise in circulation to pay back all  the debt and all the interest on the  debt outstanding so people losing their  homes and their businesses and their  resources etc is built into the system  on purpose now when there's an expansion  of the money supply and expansion of  money in circulation peter paying Paul  that seems you know to hide it  to an extent but once you squeeze the  money supply you take money out of  circulation it becomes obvious that  there's nothing like enough money in  circulation to pay back all the debt so  these people losing their homes  their resources they're  things that they own for no other reason  that there simply is not enough money  for everyone to pay back the debt so  what do the banks do whoo we'll have that  and this has been going on for centuries  and they've hijacked the real wealth  of the world by doing this and the next  stage which is in my books from the  early 1990s is the cashless society you  know I was pointing out purely by  knowledge of what this agenda was  that they were going to get rid of cash  and look look at it cash is flying out  of circulation some places like Sweden  is all almost totally cashless they're  shutting down Bank branches so you  cannot interact with a bank branch  locally with cash you have to do it  online because that's the electronic  money and eventually they're gonna take  a cash our circulation why  because when you go into a store now or  anywhere and you  give them a credit card electronic  money and they say sorry  the system won't accept your card well  you can still pay cash but when there's  no cash in circulation your electronic  money which is meant to go through a  microchip eventually  when they say the system  won't accept your microchip  or your card you have no other means  of purchase so whoever controls  the system is dictating whether you can  purchase or whether you can't whether  you can eat or whether you can't and the  only other alternative to that would be  barter and I'll tell you what the plan  is the plan is to ban barter to make it  illegal on the basis that they can't tax it  so that's along the line as well  How does cryptocurrency play into this?  I'm not saying that  there couldn't be good things  with things like Bitcoin  and stuff like that as long as cash  stays in circulation that's the key  while cash is in circulation you have  other points or ways of purchase  once there's no cash and you have only  cashless digital currencies then whoever  controls them controls everything  and not only that they  can wipe your bank account  if you're a dissident to the  system as this moves on into more  extremes they can wipe your bank account  and it's just gone because all  it is is figures on the screen you can  wipe figures on a screen in a second you  can from a central point crash the  entire economy  by controlling digital money and digital  processes and the idea eventually  the problem, reaction, solution create the  problem and then offer the solution is  to have a gigantic crash which they will  instigate and then to overcome the crash  they will propose a totally new economic  system of central control to be the  solution to the problem they've created  which is crashing the economy and the  more control they have over money  digitally electrically the easier it is to do that ",1
265,in mid-october of 1964 kissing cousins Elizabeth and Philip paid a royal visit to a Catholic residential school for Aboriginal children in Kamloops British Columbia Canada William Koons was 12 years old at the time of the royal visit I was an inmate at the Kamloops school when we were visited said Coombs I remember it was strange because they came by themselves no big fanfare or nothing but I recognized them and the school principal told us it was the Queen and we all got given new clothes and good food for the first time in months the day before she arrived the day the Queen got to the school I was part of a group of kids that went on a picnic with her and her husband and some of the priests we went down to a meadow near Deadman's Creek I remember it was weird because we all had to bend down and kiss her foot and she was wearing a white lace boot after a while I saw the Queen and her husband lead the picnic with 10 children from the school and those kids never returned they took away those 10 kids and nobody ever saw them again we never heard anything more about them and we never met them again even when we were older they were all from around there but they all vanished the group that disappeared was seven boys and three girls in age from 6 to 14 years old they were all from the smart group in the class two of the boys were brothers and they were maybe from quenelle their last name was our news or Arnold I don't remember the others just an occasional first name like Cecilia and there was an Edward what happened was also witnessed by my friend George Adolphe who was 11 years old at the time and a student there too but he's dead now William combs the sole survivor was scheduled to appear as the star witness at the International Tribunal in two crimes of church and state in London England but William Coombs never made it to the tribunal he died of unknown causes shortly before he was scheduled to testify Reverend Kevin Annette a former minister of the United Church of Canada believes that William Coombs was murdered to stop him from speaking out about the Royal abductions and other crimes of murder and torture that he had witnessed at the school in a nutshell what happened was I was letting people speak from the pulpit about the crimes had seen in the residential school the murders in that I also found out about the land deals that were happening where the church was selling off native land of big logging companies for kickbacks and I wrote a letter about that to the church I was fired without cause and eventually thrown out of the church without any due process at all you know but that one thing led to another and I began to work about a lot more with the survivors after that the eyewitness ,1
75,"There they don't want what we know You will never get these on CNBC School system Will never tell us these Because they are part of it Disguised money Hypocritical teacher False assets I know the game of the rich My rich dad taught me You know because you are a banker Banker is a rich player It's different from what they taught you in school in this world How does the school teach you money? The answer is: nothing This is neither an error Not by accident I know, most people also know Ways to keep the middle class working hard Is never to teach them what the rich know So if you read ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad"" published in 1997 A book on how rich people teach their children about money The poor and the middle class did nothing Poverty is hurt I mean, I don't like this And I don't like that our academic system is so corrupt We know the banking system is corrupt We know political corruption But academia is equally corrupt I think banking and politics are the same thing But this is where we send the kids We believe they will do the right thing for children however They are not taught so basic Just like when you asked your father when you were a kid Ask your teacher When do you tell or teach us about money? Then they just Say nothing I will never tell you what do you know? Share it What is financial education? It is not Get a job, work hard or save money And invest in a diversified portfolio of investment finance Stocks, funds or ATF The financial industry contains two things: debt and taxes Nixon removed the dollar from the gold standard in 1971 This turned the dollar into debt However, we still tell children to learn and get jobs Work hard, save money and get out of debt Who is telling them to do this? This is simply ridiculous The first line of the book says Saving money will make you rich Actually, it never will, you know We are all taught to be children Why do you save money? Why do you work for it If they can be printed Faster than you work for it Why do you keep it when it is printed? The rich never work for money You don't touch those things This is a very delicate right, isn't it? They won't say I will train you to be a worker bee for the rest of your life But they somehow teach you where to go This is why you came here What else? What do they want to do? What did you do for them in the first few months? What is he trying to get from you? Because he teaches you how to get money Let's try to say if you are ready to succeed in life You need to find the best teacher And a good teacher always comes from inside, not from outside But at school you do nâ€™t know Is your mentor true or false This is the source of hypocritical teachers I said: I want you to teach me money Why should I teach you? But if I teach you, you need to work for me for free Then I said: Why is it free? My dad, my poor dad got angry, he said If I pay you, you will think like an employee Your brain will change If you learn to never work for money You will become rich This is a right, once you give someone a salary Their brains will shut down Then the promise of pensions One job guarantee This is the disguised salary After you stop working Give this man a fish, eat it for a day, and teach him how to fish Can eat for a lifetime Most poor people are confused Assets and liabilities They think their house is an asset and a liability Yes Assets are nouns, like a house Cash is liquid, is a verb So to understand whether it is assets or liabilities Like a noun plus a verb If cash flows out of your pocket It is debt If cash goes into your pocket, money flows It is an asset I own 7000 properties for rent They are all assets and have cash inflows every month Many people have big houses on the hill But cash out Then they are going bankrupt It's like a frame of mind Another thing the poor don't understand is For most people, the most important expense is taxes Yes, we haven't even seen it, isn't it weird? You look around You look at your salary and say they are a bit wrong But you didn't realize The government has put a huge hand in your pocket And you can't do anything to minimize it This is what makes the rich and the poor very different The rich do not work for money, the first cost is taxes You see, there are 3 kinds of income here. Profit, portfolio, passive income So profit is earned income, if I get a job, this is my income If I am a doctor or programmer, that is my income Because i work for it If I buy an apple for $ 10, I sell for $ 20 That's, uh ... Portfolio income, capital gains But passive income, that is, cash flow But never taxed That's why these guys are screaming in the United States now Too many taxes and good luck Because most complainers do nâ€™t know There are actually 3 types of income In any case, the rich do not have any jobs They have assets So the average is smaller than the poor guys there You know send kids to school and they won't learn this You see, few people buy me Make $ 1 million but pay zero taxes When my rich dad taught me to play Monopoly That's how it changes, the difference between 4 green houses and a red hotel Or the origin of McDonald's? McDonald's is real estate business They sell hamburgers and then they buy real estate So they don't pay taxes You know this guy Bezos, he has $ 16 billion How much tax did he pay for this $ 16 billion? zero However all this is legal and anyone can do it Most people lack education So you have to learn how to use debt as money You can never say i can't afford it You see, because the bank will give you money So these banks, after the 2008 financial crisis The bank gave me $ 300 million tax free When I asked ordinary people, I said, can you? Why not choose debt? They ca nâ€™t even get a loan Because they score This Fico score, they only have those there Just too bad The school teacher will never tell you these Because they don't know My poor dad never knew this You don't know if something is an asset or a liability Until you can say it in cash flow So the house, is it an asset or a liability? If you are taking money from a bag This is a liability If you put money into your pocket, this is the asset The U.S. government wants us to provide housing Provide work, and ask us to borrow money Because this is how to create money through debt Like a huge tax benefit Everyone can do the same thing If they all have financial education to do it If people understand tax policies, we will become more prosperous But can poverty also be genetically inherited? This is because of a certain way of thinking And an attitude It's very simple when people ask me how can I stop all this? I just, never say, I ca nâ€™t afford it Ask yourself, what should I do? Why i have so much money Because I never said, I can't do it, I just do it, what should I do? Then I just do it! I made a lot of mistakes But this is how I learn, how can I do it? But the poor, like my poor dad Always say i can't afford Do you think I did it with money? I'm a school teacher, I can't do it! I chose to give up My rich dad never used words like this So whenever I meet the poor I use words like ""I can\'t"" Many times These people will say, I ca nâ€™t afford it, I ca nâ€™t do it I can't go to college The rich are evil now I choose not to participate This is one thing people can change today It's a conversation in their head Stop saying the word ""can\'t"" So, what should I do? Especially when I ca nâ€™t afford it, how can I afford it? Because it made them start to think of it as an investment For a better future Yes, like when I borrowed $ 300 million I can't do it when I just want to ask When I was rejected many times, I think you know Whenever I show my finances to the bank, they leave Sorry please take a look Do me a favor, why do you reject me he told me This is how the numbers are here So if I fix those numbers Can I see you again? So it's called rejection My wife also rejected me for 6 months It's just about personal will, it's mental ability So i said If they can do it, I can do it too But what should I do? I think this is what you once said Speech becomes a limb Intelligence and experience will increase through your mistakes Up and down Or let you learn something Real estate is real estate But what I learned made me rich, not money He taught me that money is only used to make money You know i think we all Everyone has a trough of life But if they get the information A new life will begin If they do nâ€™t have the information, they will continue to fall I get richer because I don't need any money I can use them to make money But how did I get there, I made so many mistakes People are afraid to make mistakes Everything is afraid of failure Good, good, very good Many people can feel this sound",1

216,[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you take the red pill and i show you how deep the rabbit hole goes crow man but when the hitting hit i might milly rock to get up off it in the new days with my always that there's something wrong with the world you don't know what it is but it's there according to entertainment television in response to little nasdaq's latest video you see this is very scary for me people will be angry they will say i'm pushing an agenda but the truth is i am he is admitting he is pushing an agenda he is an influencer of the youth this agenda is targeting our children his presence and actions are a pre-planned movement his initial release of all town road soared to number one on the billboard 100 for 19 weeks becoming the first song in history to remain that long at the top mainstream entertainment heavily promoted his song as suitable for children old town road has become very familiar with the youth i saw you first does your mom tell you after mentioning boobies in all time i'm here to promote my little book c is for country i'm just out here you know my kids now have grown very attached to your book you know majority of that success i would like a tribute to kids his song was even used as lullabies for children and i actually sing a version of the lullaby song to my daughter she loves it she just goes ape crazy every time i play it this boy having a tool to old town row she was shocked because daniel has autism and is mostly non-verbal i mean it took us six months to teach him the letter a and without being taught are you telling me he's humming this song it's music that's how we reach him that's how we teach him the power of music isn't that something yeah and three of chalet's poor children have autism but daniel has not progressed like the other kids with therapy so this music and what is happening with him and repeating those lyrics is a really big deal repeating those lyrics is a really big deal what kind of message are the lyrics truly promoting it's a message of break the rules and do what is pleasing to you it is the same deeply satanic philosophy held by countless other prominent performers the do what you wilt philosophy by aleister crowley this meeting just begun i'm satan's son this satanic philosophy heavily impacts children don't even flip me off finger back where it belongs the power of music it's not just about breaking the rules but little naz's videos progressively condition his viewers which many are children into the occult his latest video perverts many biblical references it pushes agendas [Music] what has this world come to it's come to a world where drag kids actually exist and people do ketamine on a couch [Music] and one of which is pure satanism where little naz proceeds to give satan a highly graphic lap dance that none of us need to see and it wraps up with him taking over satan's dominion to top it all off he releases satan's shoes complete with satanic pentagrams and a drop of human blood mixed with dye with only 666 available they all sold out in under a minute the boxart contains an incredible level of satanic detail and of course luke 10 18 i saw satan fall like lightning from heaven luke 10 18 has been touched upon previously in my videos with countless artists obsession with lightning symbolism he's flashing all the same symbolism previously covered including wearing a black and white tile masonic jacket and all seeing eye jackets [Music] and one of their favorites covering the right eye and in my opinion it really is just an artist's way of expressing himself is this really all just art when he explicitly stated that he has an agenda is this really just soul art when they are using all the same symbolism and it just happens to be satanic symbolism watch my video innocent arts or packed with satan that thoroughly breaks down whether the quote-unquote art we are continually exposed to is innocent or is there something more sinister behind it not only that this video and my latest video sports contract with satan discloses what all this symbolism means check them out soon before more of my videos are taken down by youtube what were you doing last year last year i was i was on my i was at my sister's house i was sleeping on my sister's floor so how did a little nas really get to the status he is now a year later from sleeping on your sister's floor you had the number one first history making number one song for 16 weeks in a row 19 weeks in a row he came into the position he is now the same way countless other artists have i sold my soul to the i can't devil it no no i can't say no i made a bargain with it you know long time ago and i'm holding up my hand what was your bargain to get where uh i am now should i ask who you made the bargain with [Music] with with you know with the chief uh commander on this earth and this earth and then in the world we can't see i wanted to be like the amy grant of music yeah but it didn't work out and so i sold myself to the dev katy perry was originally a gospel singer but she was going nowhere with her career as she admits she sold her soul and started producing secular music with occultic symbolism and occultic messages with even her in hell with satanic themes and now she is highly successful it's the same story repeated over and over again in the music video can't feel my face by the weekend he is going nowhere with his music career until the devil literally lights him on fire this makes the crowds ready for him and his music satan is not a fairy tale he is very real satan the father of lies is running this world until judgment day he is going to bring as many people as possible to where he's going and he's targeting our children satan uses music artists actors actresses to initially appear innocent for the children to follow so what did you feel and what inspired you to come out at that time how it would be good for the youngins who listening to me right now and then those performers fall way off the beaten path into the occult in satanism taking the children down with them this has happened over and over again [Music] miley received her own pair of little naz's satan's shoes [Music] and disney is infamous for releasing films that appear innocent and are not and for releasing pure occultic films for your children to watch how it would be good for the youngins who listening to me right now little nastax is a pawn used by the true controlling entities of this world to test the waters to see a society is willing to accept blatant satanism and to see how close we are to accepting the coming antichrist they think you're some kind of god the man who returned from the dead [Music] the last days are indeed upon us this world isn't just moving in some haphazard and random direction it's running full steam ahead fulfilling saiyan's hands in the world in biblical prophecy saying is not a myth spiritual warfare is amping up your souls and your children's souls are at sake do you see the direction the world is heading and want answers to this the solution lies in the way the truth the life yeshua jesus our hope is in what lies ahead beyond this life for what is your life it is a vapor that appears for a little time and then vanishes away however for all that repent which is whatever is hindering you from god whether it be sin or whatever you turn from that and you turn to him and believe on the lord jesus christ true belief is lived out in our daily lives yet the god of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not bless the light of the glorious gospel christ who is the image of god should shine onto them so do as christ has commanded go therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit teaching them to observe all the things whatsoever i have commanded you jesus asserts and why do you call me lord lord and do not do the things that i say if you love me you keep my commandments because eyes have not seen nor ears have heard nor has it come into the heart of man what god has prepared for those that love him the time is fulfilled the kingdom of god is at hands repent and believe the gospel second corinthians 2 11 declares for us not to be ignorant of satan's devices ephesians 5 11 asserts for us to expose evil so please share this documentary and the videos to come we must wake up people to the deception of this world before it is too late let's work together to overcome may the peace of god be with you and your family [Music] you ,1
337,[Music] what happened next in june 77 the fbi told me my life was in grave danger they had wiretapped a meeting at a mafia social club in brooklyn bill ayers and some black panthers and a gambino monster named paul castellano was there they all agreed i must be a federal agent and they put out a contract on me the weatherman the panthers and the mafia a triple threat [Music] what did you do well i i was very nervous it would be easy for anyone to shoot me on stage [Music] bullets would not bounce off me like they did captain marvel jr [Music] so i called president carter and i asked him for secret service protection but he said it was something only the president can have so i told him i was running for president he laughed but said he would recommend me for the witness protection program i realized if i was alive that lisa marie and daddy would be in danger and mama had died so young and i lost my twin brother i had to find a way to live for them that's when i remembered master comics number 110 captain marvel jr and a hidden death i must have read it 100 times it was where captain marvel jr faked his own death to deceive his enemies then he defeated them and came back as a hero that was my way out what about giving up your music career he was at a dead end and i i couldn't make any money selling records because in 73 the colonel has sold my royalties to rca to cover gambling deaths by early 77 the colonel was into the las vegas hilton for 20 million the fbi tipped me off that he has sold half my contract to paul castellano to pay it off i wasn't working for an italian crime syndicate since i got back from the army my career was kind of a living death anyway and all those bad movies and now i was just an image in people's minds so why not just kill the image and come back later as my own damn self i i can work undercover to defeat my enemies like captain marvel jr had done then after a year or two i could return as an american hero and restart my music career just like when i came back from germany it would be fantastic what did the others think about the fake death idea colonel parker dr nick [Music] the colonel said it was a great move public relations wise that it'd be a great way to make money off the fans you see the colonel couldn't control me anymore in life i was sick of him i was more valuable to him dead dr nick said it would help me get off the prescriptions i had come to realize that just because i was getting it from a doctor didn't mean it was good for me today entertainers submitted and they go to drug rehab and the fans don't mind but you couldn't do it at that time how did you put the plan together to fake your death we came up with a fantastic design just like captain marvel jr had done dr nick had a terminal patient with no family who was a big fan and he looked a lot like me my height my age so dr nick suggested that we let him come to the pool house at graceland to live then when he expired we could swap his body for mine dr nick gave him some cosmetic surgery got him looking even more like me what was his name roscoe holloway he was from germantown tennessee the only problem was roscoe was heavier than me he went about 250 and i was only 170. so i ate a lot of ice cream and fried foods especially late at night so we would match up when it came time but how could you possibly pick a date for a roscoe to pass away august 15 was our target date because i had to testify for a grand jury against frederick crowe he ran air cargo airlines out of florida it was a mafia front company for stealing aircraft i sold him one of my airplanes in the state dr nick was sure roscoe would expire in time and then he'd keep him on life support so we planned the body swap and everyone's job on august 15th i put on my dea staff suit i testified for the grand jury then i went home and went to my dentist around 11 pm since i wouldn't be able to see him for a long time then then i got everyone out of the house my cousin billy and my girlfriend ginger she looked just like mama when she was young i i called her little gladys we went to play wreck ball at what time it was around 2 am once we left my house dr nick went to the pool house and took roscoe off life support then he and joe dressed roscoe in my blue pajamas and put his body in my bathroom closet ginger and i went back to the house around 6 a.m i went to bed after a while i i told her i was going to read in the bathroom then then i took a sedative dr nick had given me and i went to sleep on the bathroom floor at about two in the afternoon ginger woke up came into the bathroom and saw me lying there [Music] i heard her holler to jail that i had fainted so joe came running upstairs and put on a pretty good show and called 9-1-1 then dr nick came running in when the ambulance arrived i i slowed my breathing for the mix i remember that in martial arts dr nick ordered them to put an oxygen mask on me and fetch a stretcher that's when we did the body squat i got into the closet dr nick put the oxygen mask on roscoe and set him on the floor then the medics came back and put roscoe on the stretcher dr nick went along in the ambulance so he could identify the body at the hospital as pelvis president presley tonight august 16th good evening elvis presley died today he was 42 his doctor pronounced him dead at three o'clock this afternoon what did you do next what was the plan for you first thing was i had to bust out of the bathroom closet because they locked the door on me then i went out the bathroom window onto the rooftop [Music] the plan was for a dea helicopter to pick me up now i was going to fly to argentina until things were over then all the cattle was in michigan but the helicopters saw a television crew outside the gate and left so i shimmed down the side of the house and walked into the schoolhouse it is a scene in memphis thousands of people middling around outside the mansion where elvis presley's body lives was it part of the plan to have a public viewing of the body the day after no no it wasn't as soon as my so-called death was announced colonel parker got a call from paul castello who screamed at him this is [ __ ] the colonel got scared and insisted on an open casket to prove i had died there are no cameras allowed but the national enquirer paid my cousin bobby mann to sneak one in now at the public viewing it was said you didn't look real that's right the problem was as roscoe got sicker than being on life support he lost weight while i had gained weight so by now we didn't look much alike but daddy remembered that madame tussaud's wax museum in london had sculpted my head for a wax dummy and sent it for approval [Music] still had to wax head in his office back in the house [Music] so we glued on some sideburns and hair i thought the hairline was too homework dude's a body his novel looked kind of powdery looking and his hair piece uh something glued on something like just didn't look right i just didn't believe it was him another problem was madame tussaud have made a 25 year old elvis head so it looked too young but in show business you work with what you have then for the body we took a wax mannequin from out of my closet where i kept my costumes and the wax head and body caused another problem it was so hot in memphis in august we had to put an air conditioner in the coffin to keep the wax from melting afternoon temperatures rose into the 90s the scheduled viewing of presley's body was delayed an hour people began fainting so at the funeral they wear a giant candle and an air conditioner it took nine guys to carry it it looked a little suspicious were there any other major mistakes well jill was supposed to say i was found in the bathroom but but he mixed it up with an earlier story we discussed that i was found in bed well i was upstairs and he wasn't breathing [Music] another problem was dr nick had me fill out my death certificate in june he was supposed to type it up but his secretary filed the original that was in my handwriting what about the spelling of your middle name on the gravestone why the extra a a-a-r-o-n instead of just a-r-o-n as on your birth certificate that wasn't a mistake it was intentional who wants to see their name on their grave i had no intention of putting a hex on myself why didn't they drink your casket in an american flag as an ex-army officer that would have been disrespectful to the flag and others who gave their lives for our country anything else to add about making your day well i i i feel badly to this day because you know i know roster was dying but i suspect dr nick may have finished him off to keep the schedule ,1
305,"Thirty years with the CIA 1964 to 1994. I worked for the government for 35 years starting
with the Marine Corps from 1964 to 1968 with service in Vietnam. I was 25 years as a Professional Intelligence
Officer with CIA. Almost 5 years in the Pentagon, and the last
almost 3 of that working in the Office of Secretary Defense. I spent almost 20 years with the State Department,
3 years in Athens as a political counselor the chief of the political section. I'm a retired colonel of the United States
Army, military intelligence special forces. I was previously with the State Department
office of counter terrorism in 1989 to 1993, part of that I worked with the Central Intelligence
Agency. I'm a former Senior Estimates Officer with
the Central Intelligence Agency. I started actually as a science fellow at
the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and became the chief scientist of the Arms Control
Agency. For 27 years I was an analyst first of Soviet
Affairs and then a wide of responsibilities. I'm a congressman representing the 30th District
in Los Angeles. I've just completed almost 3 decades of service
to the United States. Most recently, I was an Assistant Secretary
of Defense in the Pentagon from 1994 to 2001. I served for 23 years in the American Foreign
Services Diplomat. I worked for the CIA for 28-and-a-half years. I joined the agency in 1988, joining with
what was then known as the National Photographic Interpretation Center. I'm a Washington Editor of the Nation Magazine. I've been doing that for about 16 years now. I'm the Labor MP for our Constituency in Birmingham
for Birmingham Ladywood. I've been the MP for 20 years. For 30 years I was a Diplomat serving my country
abroad and my last position, however, was as Ambassador to Saudi Arabia during the Gulf
War. July of 1970, the president asked to me to
come over to the White House Counsel and I served for roughly 1000 days until it all
fell apart. Twenty-three years as a Commission Officer
of the United States Army. I came back to public service in 2001 to be
the Secretary of the Army. I spent 21 years in the CIA, of that time,
I spent 90% in Middle East. I'm a former Weapons Inspector with the United
Nations in Iraq. I served in that capacity from 1991 to 1998. I worked for the CIA for 20 years from 1966
to 1986. I've worked on assessing secret nuclear weapons
programs for almost 20 years. Never expected that I'd leave the Navy and
become the chief spoke of our country, the Director of Central Intelligence but that
happened. Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction. Iraq weapons of mass destruction. A clear threat to the United States. There's dozens of ballistic. It is sponsored and sheltered terrorists. Paying suicide bombers. Chemical weapons are equally. Biological weapons including anthrax and botulism
toxins. Biological and chemical agents to kill millions
of people. Chemical weapons including VX and Sarin, mustard
gas. To a massive and sudden horror. Massive death and destruction. Death on a massive scale. The danger to our country is grave. The danger to our country is growing. The Iraqi Regime possesses biological and
chemical weapons. The Iraqi Regime is building the facilities
necessary to make more biological and chemical weapons. And according to the British Government, the
Iraqi Regime could launch a biological or chemical attack in as little as 45 minutes
after the order were given. The Regime has long-standing and continuing
ties to terrorist's organizations and their Al-Qaeda terrorists inside Iraq. The Regime is seeking a nuclear bomb and with
fissile material could build one within a year. The Bush Administration made its mind to go
to war on September the 11th, 2001. That very first day on September 12, one day
after September 11, the meeting that was held in the White House in the Situation Room led
to Rumsfeld asking the question, ""Shouldn't we use this as an opportunity to do something
about Iraq as well'? We all said, ""But no, no Al-Qaeda is in Afghanistan
we need to bomb Afghanistan"" and Rumsfeld said, ""There aren't any good targets in Afghanistan
and there are lots of good targets in Iraq."" From that time on, you were dealing with rationalization
and justification for the war. You weren't dealing with real causes for the
war or real reasons for the war. There was never clear present danger. There was never an imminent threat. With weapons of mass destruction. Weapons of mass destruction. Weapons of mass death. Weapons of mass destruction was a convenient
way of tricking our congress into giving the president authority to wage this war. Saddam has resumed his efforts to acquire
nuclear weapons. Develop nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons. It was clear that Iraq did not have a nuclear
weapons program but over and over again, President Bush, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld particularly
Vice-President Cheney but also National Security Advisor Condi Rice drummed up the idea of
a reconstituted nuclear capability and particularly the notion that I think has some residence
of wronging the American people of the ""Mushroom Cloud."" Leaders will use worse case assessments that
point to nuclear weapons to generate political support because they know people fear nuclear
weapons so much. The evidence was simply not there. [Inaudible] would asked to explain, you know,
how good is the evidence? Can you tell us more about it? This is NATO mind you and he'd say, ""Well,
it's like this it's like pornography. Hard to describe but you recognize it when
you see it."" My God! And we're going to war on that? If someone is waiting for a so-called smoking
gun, it's certain that we will have waited too long. We don't want the smoking gun to be a mushroom
cloud. We cannot wait for the final proof, the smoking
gun. It could come in the form of a mushroom cloud. So, a lot people who supported the war in
Iraq actually believed that Iraq had the capability to fire missiles that could reach the United
States carrying payloads of nuclear or chemical or biological weapons. Iraq has never had the capability to do that. They didn't have in the first Gulf War. They didn't have it in this war in Iraq and
they don't have it, anyway of getting it in the future. What the Bush Administration did was try to
round up as many people as they could who would make the case for them. What the White House wanted was the CIA to
give it talking points to justify this war, it already made up its mind. Massive intervention by people particularly
from Vice-President Cheney's office and Vice-President Cheney himself in the process. And I think the intelligence analysts found
themselves really up against it when they tried to argue that those connections weren't
as tight as people were saying. Intelligence director of the Department of
Energy simply ordered his experts who has raised questions about the evidence being
used on the nuclear end of it as the news accounts say ""to sit down and shut up"" so
that the DOE would be onboard with the overall estimate. They were not given the opportunity to speak
because no one wanted to hear what they said. And I was in chief of collecting information
on Iraq through the mid90s. I know what we had and what we didn't have
and I'm here to tell you there was no information. I understand that the director himself, George
Tenet is now accompanying the briefer in the morning and this never happened in the past. In the past we were trusted, there were senior
people, we knew what the score was and when I hear that George Tenet is going down with
the senior briefer I wonder why. And the very heavy leaning on the director
of Central Intelligence and his staff to produce precisely the language which would allow them
to make the statements which they had been making to support the decision to go into
Iraq. Well, not only by their physical presence
but by the questions they asked, by the ""well don't you think?"" sort of things, ""well couldn't it be possible
that?"" They call this data mining, going back over
old information and coming with new conclusions. And the overwhelming opinion from the scientists
of this government at the Department or Energy and even at the CIA and some of the State
Department were arguing against using weapons of mass destruction as a case to go to war. You're talking about the Vice-President of
the United States and you're talking about a GS-13 or 14, a midlevel analyst in the Central
Intelligence Agency. You're talking about a person who should have
career protection for telling it like it is but who knows that his chief, the director
of the CIA is a member of the team, you know? A lot of pressure on that. It shouldn't happen. The whole purpose the CIA was to leave those
people out at Langley that's why they're not in Washington, they're in Northern Virginia
away from the White House, away from congress, leave them alone, ask them what they think
but don't tell them to rethink their positions because then you come up with nonsense like
we saw. The administration had decided very early
on that Saddam should go and that in itself is not a bad goal, but of course, everything
depends on how you do it when, how, where, with whom, etcetera. Preemptive war by its very nature is something
that is entirely new to the United States of America and to what we call the old western
alliance. That's, you know, you go back through history
and at the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 a group of nations that had just killed most of each
other off decided that this isn't quite the way to do it and they came up with a set of
laws that we've all lived with fairly well since then which doesn't much allow for preemptive
war. Delay in decision and in action could lead
to a massive and sudden horror. It simply makes no sense to wait any longer. Take action before it's too late. We will not wait. I believe it is essential that when we see
a threat we deal with those threats before they become imminent. It's too late if they become imminent. As President Bush has said, ""time is not on
our side."" It was a rushed and I believe it was done
I believe in 3 or 4 weeks which is really fast for that. It wasn't done earlier from what I understand
because the Bush Administration didn't want such a document that had caveats. That's why they never asked for a comprehensive
National Intelligence Estimate within the intelligence community on this particular
problem because they knew the intelligence community didn't agree on any of these issues. The National Intelligence Estimate is really
about, I don't know 5 major players but 10 intelligence agencies in total weighing in
on the basic situation with weapons of mass destruction. It only happened because the head of the senate
intelligence committee, Graham called for it and so I think the Bush Administration
resisted having an NIE and then once it was out, selectively picked what was useful to
their argument. Most of their qualifications were simply filtered
out. The standardization of the original estimate
was not true to its real meaning. All the modifiers were dropped off. It was a prosecutor making a case using what
benefited his case ignoring evidence that would undermine his case and there was no
defensive attorney to give us the other side. And the end product used by policy makers
particularly in its discussion with the American public were much more forceful than could
have possibly been when originally written by CIA, DIA or State Departments Intelligence
and Research. It was a bizarre warping of the intelligence
process and they thought they would be able to get away with it because who's going to
see the classified version? Well, later several months later, they released
parts of the classified version. They thought no one would notice. So, this was not a case where the National
Intelligence Estimate was driving the war. This was to provide an excuse after the fact. Going to war based on intelligence is yet
another example, I think, of intelligence simply not being able by nature, by definition
to live up to that kind of requirement. You may produce intelligence that could keep
you out of a war but I doubt that you'll ever get 1, 2, 3 reports of intelligence that will
in any way allow you to go to war. There are Al-Qaeda in Iraq. Saddam Hussein cavorts with terrorists. Secretly, without fingerprints he could provide
one is hidden weapons to terrorists or help them develop their own. Well, the war really has absolutely nothing
to do with terrorism. There was no connection whatsoever between
Iraq and the secular regime there and the religious fanatics who perpetrated 9/11. They wanted to believe that there was a connection
but the CIA was sitting there, the FBI was sitting there, I was sitting there saying
""we've looked this issue for years, for years we have looked for a connection."" Well, there's just no connection. Saddam was not a maniac or a fool. He was a terrible villain, yes but he was
not going to sacrifice his own life and the future of his country to stupid adventures
with terrorists who had completely antithetical views to his. It is just inconceivable to anybody who understands
Saddam Hussein and understands the nature of highly centralized dictatorships. Generally, that dictators would want to give
up control of their most potent weaponry because once you've given up control, you have no
control so you can't say to Al-Qaeda you will use this or you won't use it. The decision of whether or not they're going
to use it depends on what Osama bin Laden does. Do you want to entrust your fate to Osama
bin Laden and his nihilistic ways? I don't think so, Saddam Hussein is a psychopath
and sociopath, he was not an irrational being in the sense he was going to ensure his own
demise by doing something like that. Al-Qaeda has had total contempt for Saddam
Hussein himself. He's been a socialist. He's been very harsh. He's treated Islamic leaders, Islamist leaders
extremely harshly. Iraq and we have very good intelligence on
this. It was not part of the picture of terrorism
before we invaded. Saddam Hussein and Bin Laden where enemies. Bin Laden considered and said that Saddam
Hussein was the socialist infidel. These were very different kinds of individuals
competing for power in their own way and Saddam Hussein made very sure that Al-Qaeda couldn't
function in Iraq, that terrorists couldn't function except for the small northeastern
quadrant of the country where was and extremist group but he had no control over that. I was near the Iranian border. There's no doubt that Ansar al-Islam is a
radicle Islamic terrorist group with ties to Al-Qaeda but they operate in a part of
Iraq that is not controlled by Hussein. The leaders say they seek to overthrow Hussein
and his government. They are our enemy, really they are also our
enemy. We believe that Saddam Hussein, him and his
group and his ministers, also they are outside of Islamist zone. And the ties with Al-Qaeda was just a scare
tactic to exploit the trauma, the very real trauma that the American people have felt
ever since 9/11 and to associate that trauma with Iraq. As you know from the polls, most Americans
believe that Iraq had something to do with 9/11 and it was a very successful, very deliberate
and very unethical and immoral operation on the part of the PR people in this administration. We now know that Saddam has resumed his efforts
to acquire nuclear weapons. Among other sources we've gotten this from
firsthand testimony from defectors. Access to immigrants and defectors with more
direct access to these programs. From 3 Iraqi defectors we know that Iraq in
the late 1990s had several mobile biological weapons. It's only after defectors told us about it. Their inspectors were in the country. The most important information that inspectors
have ever gotten on what's going on in Iraq have come from defectors. We know about that capability from defectors
and other sources. A recent defector stated that as recently
as August of 19/08 that's while inspections were still going on, a formal order was issued
to proceed with a nuclear program at full blast. Our strategy is to bring to the world the
danger that Saddam poses in his current state. Without doubt, he is developing weapons of
mass destruction. Without doubt, he has chemical and biological
weapons and without doubt, for 30 years he has been trying to acquire a nuclear weapon. The usual scrutiny of these kind of guys was
just not done adequately, that there was this attitude of let's find the smoking gun, let's
find the evidence rather than let's look at what's out there and weigh the evidence. They wanted to believe him. It goes back to contacts that originated as
early as the 1990s with individuals like Dick Cheney, like Paul Wolfowitz, like Richard
Perle dealing with Ahmad Chalabi. They became enamored of this fellow who dressed
like a westerner, talked with a British accent and appeared to be uppercrossed and therefore
was quite believable. And everyone in Washington was believing them
and I thought people had really somehow checked out of reality in order to go to war, that
is a war fever that had taken over. These people wanted to get back into Bagdad. They couldn't defeat Saddam Hussein but they
knew that U.S. Military power could, so the worst of these offenders who would be Ahmad
Chalabi who has been in exile for his own country for 20 to 30 years and is clearly
not a hero under any definition of heroism to his own people sold the Pentagon on the
idea that Saddam Hussein did have weapons of mass destruction and he must be stopped. But they were bringing forward individuals
who they claimed were either high-level military or scientist with access. They were looking for money first of all cause
Chalabi was paying money. Supplying money shouldn't be a surprise. That's how informants are dealt with in the
spy business. But there was no effort to check their bonafides,
none. Every checkable piece of that intelligence
that's come to public notice has proven to be false or at least self-serving in the extreme. You had the U.S. Congress approve and appropriate
money for the Iraqi National Congress with no telling how much they were taking off the
top for themselves. You get all kinds of people who want a reward
and have nothing to offer and many ended up with Chalabi because they would believe anything
bad about Iraq. It was phony evidence, it was based on intelligence
we had from Iraqi exiles who wanted this country to attack Iraq so these people could then
take over in Bagdad and establish their own regime. We have to back and examine just the role
that the defectors played throughout the entire inspection process. The inspections work then you don't overthrow
Saddam Hussein. How does somebody like that, I don't know
even how to describe him, get into a position where he's determining U.S. policies? Senior members of the Department of Defense
gave him their thumbs up. His information was coming into the White
House to people like Dick Cheney through the Office of Special Plans, so it was coming
in through an avenue that's not traditional to the intelligence community and wasn't open
to being vetted or reviewed. You had Chalabi himself admit that they didn't
mind providing false information cause it helped them to achieve their goal of removing
Saddam. Nobody in Iraq will defend that regime including
the military, both the regular army and the Republican Guard. Our liberation would not have been achieved
without the determination of President George W. Bush and the commitment of the Coalition
at the forefront of which stand the people of the United States of America and Great
Britain. The Iraqis will never forget your courage
and sacrifice on our behalf. We are here today to declare that the new
Iraq is born and Iraq with dignity, justice and human rights are assured for all citizens. There is no risk of a breakup of Iraq. There is no risk of a civil war. I stand before this assembly as a representative
of free Iraq. To all those here who helped us in our struggle
for liberation we extend our gratitude. The Iraqi opposition will ensure that the
continuation of it' institutions and to reestablish democracy and the rule of law. He said, ""I got what I wanted. I got my war. I'm back in Iraq and if you people relied
on my information you're stupid."" Every year by law and by custom we meet here
to consider the State of the Union. This year we gather in this chamber deeply
aware of decisive days that lie ahead. Bush presented so many distorted beliefs,
estimates and guestimates that it appears that he was misleading the public and the
congress. Saddam Hussein had the materials to produce
as much as 500 tons of Sarin, mustard and VX nerve agent. Any Sarin that they were making in 1990-1991
had a known shelf life about 2 months. I have confirmed this with inspectors and
analysts who were deeply involved in the 1990s analyses. Well, if you made it 12 years ago and it had
a shelf life of 2 months, it may not be safe to drink but it isn't Sarin nerve gas any
longer and there is no way the agency could not have known that. U.S. Intelligence indicates that Saddam Hussein
had upwards of 30,000 munitions capable of delivering chemical agents. Inspectors recently turned up 16 of them despite
Iraq's recent declaration, denying their existence. And then they tried to use the fact that inspectors
found 16 of these as evidence that thousands more existed, and again, I mean as a methodology
it's a very weak way to predict anything and I think it borders on propaganda to argue
that the small number that had been found by inspectors implied that in this case, over
29,000 exists. Saddam Hussein has not accounted for the remaining
29,984 of these prohibited munitions. Put it this way, Bush Administration officials
either routinely said or tried to give the impression that if Iraq had not fully accounted
for all of a certain item related to chemical or biological weapons, then it must be there
and that's not all what the inspectors said or found. He hadn't accounted for that material. He's given no evidence that he has destroyed
it. And the inspectors could go in and say, okay
we can prove yeah you destroyed that set in this way or that set in that way but these
others we can't prove it and that doesn't mean that they didn't destroy these warheads
or whatever the item was, it just means Iraq hadn't been able to prove it. If Saddam Hussein had admitted to the Iranians,
to the Syrians and his own people that he had been so intimated by the U.N. inspection
and sanctions process that he had given up all that, they probably would have torn him
limb from limb. Saddam Hussein had materials sufficient to
produce more than 38,000 liters of botulin toxin, enough to subject millions of millions
of people to death by respiratory failure. He hadn't accounted for that material. Revealed his biological weapons program, particularly
it' ability to make botulin toxin and therefore it was an open issue, but again, it doesn't
mean that what the inspectors found was evidence that Iraq possessed that. Our intelligence sources tell us that he has
attempted to purchase high-strength aluminum tubes suitable for nuclear weapons production. I think there was very little doubt that the
centrifuge tubes, so-called were nothing but rocket motor tubes to go into M-81 style artillery
rockets. They certainly have all the specs for that. Nuclear experts, for instance, from Lawrence
Livermore's laboratory's Z division, the experts on centrifuge in Richmond came out and said,
""No you couldn't enrich uranium using these tubes. They're not compatible."" Well, I saw it as a deliberate attempt to
take information, selectively take information and try to basically say Iraq poses and imminent
nuclear threat and therefore action is absolutely necessary and I felt that was absolutely wrong. International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed
in the 1990s that Saddam Hussein had an advanced Nuclear Weapons Development Program. The administration showed photos of nuclear
or former nuclear weapon sites in Iraq pre-1991 nuclear weapons sites; claimed that new construction
showed they were ongoing nuclear weapons production sites, complete nonsense. The most troubling thing about the fact of
the distortions and the misleading statements that Bush gave congress is that it is a federal
felony, it's a crime to mislead and distort information and present it to the congress. The British Government has learned that Saddam
Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa. When Secretary Powell addressed the U.N. about
weapons of mass destruction he deliberately left out any reference to attempts to buy
uranium from Africa. I didn't use the uranium at that point because
I didn't think that was sufficiently strong as evidence to present before the world. CIA officials warn members of the President's
staff the intelligence was not good enough to make the statement ""Iraq tried to buy uranium
from Africa."" In October for the Cincinnati speech not for
the State of the Union, but the Cincinnati speech, George Tenet asked that this be taken
out of the Cincinnati speech, the reference to yellowcake. It was taken out of the Cincinnati speech
because whenever the Director of Central Intelligence wants something out, it's gone. How did it get back in? It's not a matter of getting back in, it's
a matter Tim that 3 plus months later people didn't remember that George Tenet had asked
that it be taken out of the Cincinnati speech and that is was cleared by the agency. The British Government has learned that Saddam
Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa. Just 16 words in the State of the Union Address,
words that we now know where misleading. A retired career diplomat Joe Wilson tried
to warn the administration of just that nearly a year before the speech. I received a call from the CIA in February
of 2002 and I was invited out to talk to those people within the broader intelligence community
who deal with 3 different subjects; Iraq, uranium and Niger. I briefed them on what I knew about the uranium
business. It was during the course of that briefing
that they said that they had received a report that had peaked the interest of the office
of the Vic-President and that report was of a purported memorandum of agreement authorizing
the sale of uranium yellowcake somewhat enriched uranium from Niger to Iraq and it was a document
that was executed by the government of Niger. They asked me if I would be willing to go
out and take another look at it and talk to people I knew there. I left there telling them that if they wanted
I would be able to free up my schedule, they subsequently called me and said ""please do."" I spent the 8 days drinking mint tea and talking
to everybody there was to talk to who knew anything about the subject matter and [inaudible]
and I had come back persuaded that it could not have happened, one from a business perspective
because of the way the consortium was structured, you just couldn't do it without a lot of people
knowing and two, the way the government bureaucracy was structured you could not make the decision
without a lot of people knowing and if you made the decision, the decision would be reflected
in a series of signatures on the documents and if the documents did not contain those
signatures they could not be authentic government of these are your documents. President quoted a British paper, we did not
know at the time, no one knew at the time in our circles, maybe someone knew down in
the bowels of the agency but no one in our circles knew that there were doubts and suspicions
that this might be a forgery. Of course, it was information that was mistaken
but the, it was a relatively small part of the case about nuclear weapons and nuclear
reconstitution. It is also the case that the broad picture
about Iraq's programs was a picture that went very far back in time. Now, given what I knew about where the question
had originated and given what I knew about the way the government works, I knew that
people in her circle did know. Based on thorough analysis, [inaudible] has
conclude with the concurrence of outside expert that these documents which form the basis
for the reports of recent uranium transaction between Iraq and Niger are in fact not authentic. Numerous French words were misspelled in the
documents. One of the letters was signed by a Niger official
who had left office 10 years ago. Several dates in the documents did not match
the day of the week. Several of the names and titles of officials
mentioned in the documents were incorrect. We all know that the documentation on yellowcake
from Niger was a fake but why doesn't anybody say who did it? Who faked the document and why don't we take
another look at then at the same stream of consciousness that was prevailing at that
moment on the aluminum tubes and the, even the trailers the bioweapons trailers that
were so badly hid, at that point someone's got to say, who is putting this intelligence
out there and why? And I don't think that question has been answered
and maybe because the answer is known and it's not a pleasant one. Who was it that asked for this review of the
Niger nuclear material question? It was the Vice-President. Mr. Wilson, former Ambassador was sent to
Niger in response to the Vice-President's questions about this issue, so assumedly the
Vice-President got a report back in response to his question and that report contained
the Wilson memo, his assessment of the situation. The question remains, who did the document? Who forged the document and why? You know, the list is possibly short, somebody
ought to be able to work on that. Wilson says his family is the subject of a
smear campaign by Senior Administration Officials. They deliberating leaked his wife's identity
as a covert CIA operative damaging her future career and compromising past missions after
he criticized the administration on Meet the Press and in the New York Times. The White House hatchet then came out and
started writing articles in which they basically said that Wilson, well the first one came
out and said that Wilson told the truth cause he's a democrat; we'll set that up as an argument. Democrats tell the truth, [inaudible] republicans
fill in the blank. Then a couple of senior administration officials
leak to Bob Novak that my wife was a CIA operative involved in the weapons of mass destruction
business at the CIA. Senior administration officials is a key to
being very, typically the President, Vice-President, cabinet officers and the top of the White
House had gone out of their way to get that information out not only told Novak, told
Time magazine they wanted the information out. Now, that's against a statutory law what prohibits
the identification of CIA operatives. What you're doing when you expose a CIA officer
of any name, you're basically taking their entire career and flushing it down the toilet. It also has the potential of placing that
person in jeopardy because of their operations and their own operations and people they have
operated with in jeopardy, so it is a very vengeful act against the ambassador to try
to hurt him by hurting his wife's career if not wishing him physical damage. I had never seen a dirty trick that could
be a hit. A President of the United States and an administration
who has come to office on a platform of restoring dignity and honor the White House what they
did was neither dignified nor was it terribly honorable nor was it germane to be the issue
at hand. First of all it should be noted that Colin
Powell's speech to the United Nations was theater, a masterful theater, effective theater
at the time. You know, here's a man who has tremendous
credibility who presents himself to the security council, to the American people, to the international
public and stares the camera in the eye and says ""he knows Iraq has weapons of mass destruction."" Leaving Saddam Hussein in possession of weapons
of mass destruction for a few more months or years is not an option. My first visual impression here watching George
Tenet be head of the Central Intelligence Agency back there as a prop almost like a
potted plant as if to say that the Central Intelligence Agency stands behind, or in this
case sits behind everything that Colin Powell says that was a terrific blow to the moral
of the Central Intelligence Agency analysts. Saddam Hussein has chemical weapons. Chemical weapons, although they can be very
deadly in a subway station or something like this are not really strategic weapons. They are weapons that can kill 50, 100, 200
people, but in fact, they won't devastate you the way a nuclear weapon in New York City
or Chicago or someplace would be a deadly blow. Saddam Hussein has used these horrific weapons
on another country and on his own people. He used weapons, Saddam Hussein did back in
the 1980s when the U.S, Administration, the Reagan Administration was actually supporting
him and allowing him to import the, of the chemical precursors for that. Donald Rumsfeld would actually as a special
envoy for Ronald Reagan back in those years helped, you know, open the door for better
relations between Washington and Bagdad. Colin Powell spoke of thousands of leaders
of anthrax that were unaccounted for. He said they're probably hiding it and then
held up a little vial of white powder and he said, a couple teaspoonfuls of white powder
like this if launched against American cities could kill thousands of Americans. If he was truly to reflect the Iraqi capability,
he would held up a bottle of diet Coke and said the Iraqis produce anthrax that looked
like this. It has a shelf life of 3 years. The last known production batch came out in
1991, so even if Iraq was hiding this brown sludge liquid, it would be useless today. Just a few weeks ago we intercepted communications
between 2 commanders in Iraq's second Republican Guard Corps. If you know anything about Iraq they have
very strict communications security procedures. So, you would never have military personnel
speaking in the clear over a radio about sensitive subjects. On the left is a close up of 1 of the 4 chemical
bunkers. There were never any chemical weapons in that
facility. I'm intimately familiar with that facility. I've inspected it a number of times. Other inspectors have inspected it many more
times than I have. To believe they were proof is to believe the
statement that Iraq would put its crown jewels in the one building or one of the few buildings
that either the United States will bomb first or the inspectors will go to first. The truck you also see is signature item,
it's a decontamination vehicle. The U.N. Weapon Inspectors knew that the truck
shown by Colin Powell in those photographs were firetrucks not decontamination trucks. I would have to comment here on Secretary
of State Colin Powell's debut as an imagery analyst. It was highly embarrassing for those of us
who know about something about the business. We couldn't tell whether this was an honest
mistake by those who now do the imagery analysis, who now report to the Secretary of Defense
unlike our day when they reported to the Central Intelligence Agency. Whether that was the case or whether perhaps
Colin Powell was being setup. From our point of view, I mean we do all kinds
of analysis of satellite imagery. You can't form any conclusions on what's going
on inside the building. They could have been building tractors. They could have been doing nothing inside
the facility. Now look at the picture on the right. You are now looking at 2 of those sanitized
bunkers. The signature vehicles are gone. It's been cleaned up and it was done on the
22nd of December as the U.N. inspection team is arriving. Contamination vehicles, they rotate from site
to site and so the absence of the vehicle on the second photo which we know is the 22nd
of December, could just as easily be explained by the normal rotation because you didn't
tell us the date of the first and it was several weeks before. We have noted that the 2 satellite images
of the sites were taken several weeks apart. The report of movement of munitions at the
site could just as easily had been a routine activity as a movement or prescribed munitions
in anticipation of imminent inspection. We have firsthand description of biological
weapons factories on wheels and rails. These mobile labs that have been shown to
be nothing more than hydrogen generation facilities. Here you see both truck and railcar mounted
mobile factories. When you take a look at the mobile labs that
Colin Powell discussed, he didn't put up photographs of these facilities. He put up artists renditions of these facilities. Why? Because we have no proof they exist. This video of an Iraqi test flight obtained
by UNSCOM some years ago shows an Iraqi F-1 Mirage jet aircraft. Note the spray coming from beneath the Mirage. That is 2000 liters of simulated anthrax. Iraqis continue to visit Bin Laden in his
new home in Afghanistan. George Tenet's analysts has spent a year-and-a-half
of tortuous investigation, tortuous analysis to see if there were ties between Al-Qaeda
and Iraq. They found none. Our conservative estimate is that Iraq today
has a stockpile between 100 and 500 tons of chemical weapons agent. So, the Secretary of State is telling us that
our conservative estimate is that Iraq possess between 100 and 500 tons of chemical weapons
agent, enough to fill 16,000 warheads on the battle field. Where are they? What happened to them? My suspicion is that this is not our conservative
estimate that this sounds very much to me like our nail conservative estimate. Iraqi denials of supporting terrorism take
their place alongside the other Iraqi denials of weapons of mass destruction. It is all a web of lies. It was a masterful performance but none of
it was true. Where are all these weapons? Where is all this VX? Where is all the anthrax? Probably one of the low points in his long
distinguished service to the nation. The old weapons inspection process was a little
more than a game. They concealed, denied, deceived. Return of inspectors would provide no assurance
whatsoever. To eliminate by inspection is quite frankly
a fool's errand. On the contrary, there's a great danger that
it would provide false comfort that Saddam was somehow back in his box. Reality is that between the original UNSCOM
inspections and the UNMOVIC inspections you destroyed with those inspections 90 to probably
95% of the Iraqi arsenal. The first Gulf War destroyed almost nothing
and, you know, postwar U.S. battle damage assessments confirmed that. The weapons inspectors were effective. They forced Saddam to get rid of his stuff. They had the country under control. By 1998 at the latest, those inspectors had
discovered most of the weapons of mass destruction and the Iraqi programs at that point were
essentially at an end. Before the war in Iraq, the United Nations
Inspectors told us that Saddam Hussein did not have nuclear weapons capability. Ironically the major effect of the invasion
of Iraq in terms of weapons of mass destruction has been to show that the inspectors were
right along. The inspection regime worked. It was the most intrusive inspection regime
in history and it worked and at the end of the day that's another reason why we went
to war for nothing. These maniacs who are encouraging out enemies,
weakening our troops resolve and confusing the American people. Well, you shouldn't listen to these protests
because they're obviously helping Saddam Hussein. Who would have guessed that you could build
a massive international peace movement on the protection of Saddam Hussein? The media is culpable for the misleading of
the American public. They bought into the Bush Administration's
rederick. They don't understand that there is moral
violence and immoral violence. We use moral violence, God bless this president. He is truly a great man. Reducing troop morale, confusing the American
people and emboldening our enemies. They are absolutely committing sedition and
treason as far as I'm concerned. There's huge difference between personal opinion
and an opinion which degrades on the basis on military in a time of war. It's a disgrace. I don't believe that mainstream media acted
responsibly in regards to Iraq. You know, I was belittle, I was called a trader. I was called crazy, Paula Zahn of CNN accused
me of drinking Saddam Hussein's Kool Aid for making accurate statements in response to
aluminum tubes. People out there are accusing you of drinking
Saddam Hussein's Kool Aid. If an idea log, then I'm a republican idea
log, I'm actually a fairly conservative person who voted for George W. Bush but I don't allow
my ideology to get in the way of the facts and the reality in my duties and responsibilities
as an American citizen. There's a tendency if you want to kill the
message to go after the messenger. If you can discredit the messenger then you
can discredit the message or if you can make the story about the messenger then people
forget about the message. And I think it's so unfair to try to silence
debate and criticism by attacking those who say something of which you disagree. The media is supposed to be the force of state
but they decided to completely climb in bed with the administration on this. In a way, the administration constructed a
box where, and that was, that box had all the information that the administration wanted
the media and the public and congress to have. What they would do is you'd have the Iraqi
National Congress taking bogus defector's information from them, giving them to the
Pentagon and then the Iraqi National Congress, then giving them to the journalists and they
said if you don't believe us, the Iraqi National Congress call up the Pentagon. So, you had this circular reporting and you've
had the New York Times admitting that it was using one source for all of its information
on weapons of mass destruction and it was, you know, self-affirming by going to the Pentagon
which put this stuff on paper. It was a lot of exaggerations, partial information
sometimes the whole information but on balance, a very one-sided view of Iraq's WMD Program. And a lot of these stories the journalists
didn't want to look into because the editors told them to run with it, we're going to be
supportive with the administration it's the patriotic thing to do. I think that was, on the part of the media,
too much of in a sense getting into the upcoming war and not enough look at do we really need
to go? There some journalists out there raising the
alarm bells. The Seymour Hershes, the Walter Pincuses of
the world but unfortunately those great investigative reporters they're usually exiled when the
heat is on and it's only after the fact that they end up being praised and given the pats
on the back. The excitement was to make the case to go
to war, you know, to show that, you know, and that was the controversy to the media
[inaudible] is, you know, it was the titillation of a WMD hitting us not the titillation of,
or the conflict of tacky administration. Both Washington Post and New York Times, they
have very conservative editors that supported the White House on this. I didn't foresee all of this. I'd like to say oh I was very prescient. I knew that the others in the Intelligence
Community were saying I didn't and I'm one of the ones who also I drank the Kool Aid,
but early on I felt that there was some real dangers going into the war and I tried to
get an op-ed into various major newspapers and the word kept coming back, nobody wants
to hear this cause we're going to war. The people of the United States and our friends
and allies will not live at the mercy of an outlaw regime that threatens the peace with
weapons of mass murder. His regime has an active program to acquire
and develop nuclear weapons and let there be no doubt about it. We know for a fact that there are weapons
there. There were a group of people who for many
years had advocated going after Saddam Hussein and they pushed this hard and, of course,
raw intelligence data can be interpreted in a lot of different ways, as I'm sure experts
will talk to about and so there were a group of people I think that were adamant that this
was the right course to pursue. We found the weapons of mass destruction,
you know, we found biological laboratories. Everybody knows that Iraq had weapons of mass
destruction. I have reason, every reason to believe that
the intelligence that we operating off was correct. No question, we have said that Saddam Hussein
possess biological and chemical weapons. We know where they are, there in the area
around Tikrit and Bagdad and east, west, south and north somewhat. This would be nuclear and, of course, the
operation for whatever duration it takes. Are you confident that you'll find weapons
of mass destruction? I believe we will find evidence of the programs
of chemical and biological weapons, yes. How about the actual weapons? Well, I just don't know. Let's wait and see what the team that's over
there. Sanctions continue with our new exploitation
teams that have been brought in. And that we will in fact find weapons or evidence
of weapon programs that are conclusive. It is somewhat puzzling I think that you can
have a 100% certainty about the weapons of mass destructions existence and zero certainty
about where they are. Do you agree and does it matter whether or
not you have these weapons? We might ask the Prime Minister that. We won't be proven wrong. This is a process that takes some time and
it will ebb and flow. One thing we know is that he had a Weapons
Programs. I don't know anybody that I can think of who
has contended that the Iraqis had nuclear weapons. We believe he has in fact reconstituted nuclear
weapons. But on the specific issue of weapons of mass
destruction it's going to take time and we're going to be patient. With time, the truth will come out. Now, it's going to take time to find anything
because they've had, they've. People will find that we presented a solid
case, as case that is there and it was there and will remain there. It's going to take a period of time to find
the people. I don't think we'll discover anything myself. Still thought that 3-and-a-half months for
new inspections was a rather short time before calling it a day and especially when we now
see that they say the U.S. Government is saying that look you have to
a bit of patience, you know, these things take time. I believe that we will find the truth and
the truth is he was developing a program for weapons of mass destruction. I think what will happen is we'll discover
people who will tell us where to go to find it. You're not going find it simply in a house
you're going to search, you're going to find it when people start to talk to you. It is not like a treasure hunt where you just
run around looking everywhere hoping you find something. I just don't think that's going to happen. The inspectors didn't find anything and I
doubt that we will. The people going to find out the truth and
the truth will say that this intelligence is good intelligence there's doubt in my mind. What will do is find the people who will tell
us. There a lot of people who lie and get away
with it and that's just a fact. He had not developed any significant capability
with respect to weapons of mass destruction. He is unable to project conventional power
against his neighbors. We are able to keep arms from him. His military forces have not been rebuilt. Is U.S. credibility on the line of weapons
of mass destruction in Iraq? I'm not exactly sure what that means. Depends on the assumptions, it depends on
how long the war lasts, it depends on where the weapons of mass destruction are used. What we have done is we have taken estimates
looking at different variables and said if this were the case on this variable and lynched
on this variable but there's so many variables that the numbers of possible point answers
create a range that simply isn't useful. I'm just not going to get into any speculation
about numbers. We're dealing with a country that can really
finance its own reconstruction and relatively simply. So, the money is going to come from Iraqi
oil revenue as everyone has said. The think it's going to be something like
2 billion dollars this year. They think it might be something like 15-12
next year. They think it might be something like 18 to
20 plus the next 19. Nineteen. The next year. I will soon submit to congress a request for
87 billion dollars. Why did the administration so dramatically
underestimate the cost of this war? We did not have perfect foresight into what
we we're going to find in Iraq. With the cost of the war rising and the search
for weapons of mass destruction going nowhere, the administration turns to David Kay. This work is being carried out under the direction
of Dr. David Kay a respected scientist and former U.N. Inspector who is leading the weapon
search in Iraq. We are determined to take this apart. We have a tremendous group of dedicated American
men and women involved in this with the best assets of the Intelligence Community and provide. Dr. Kay and his team are making progress. We have had found a large body of continuing
activities and a equipment. We are surprised by new advances that we're
making. Network with laboratories and safe houses
controlled by Iraqi Intelligence and security services. And unlike prewar intelligence, we don't require
someone just to say something, we actually need the physical evidence. Equipment suitable for continuing chemical
and biological weapons research. David Kay is not going to be done with this
for quite some time. David Kay wants more time. And he says it can take another 6 to 9 months
to makes a definitive finding. Administration is asking congress for hundreds
of millions more. Six hundred million dollars to fund the continuing
search. We have not yet found shiny, pointy things
that I would call a weapon. Before we can draw firm conclusions we need
to let the Iraq survey group complete it's work. We were all wrong probably in my judgment
and that is most disturbing. It's inevitable that there will be an outside
commission appointed on an issue of this gravity. We'll have public hearings and we will get
to the bottom of this and we will let the chips fall where they may. Democracy you have an obligation. Your obligation is to speak truthfully to
the public. That's the basis of civility and our belief
in our system of government. It is going to require outside effort probably
through an outside commission to deal with some of these very serious problems. Cause I think explanations are important in
a democracy. This whole episode has caught the White House
completely by surprise. They've become so fearful of admitting error
that they stand up and defend things that, on their face, a face are untruthful. President Bush is being pounded with calls
for an independent investigation into how U.S. Intelligence so badly misjudged Iraq's
capabilities before the war. Having your president holding all the cards,
appointing all the people, having everybody accountable to him is a very bad idea. If you say you're going to war because he
has weapons of mass destruction and you don't find those weapons, it is not persuasive to
jump to a second argument, well that didn't work but here I've got a second explanation,
I was asked if I would care to try to operationalize some of the comments I made about what was
going wrong in Iraq and so I said if you, among other things, that if you're going to
do this you had to treat it like an intelligence problem and that is not go looking for hidden
weapons but going and looking for the people who would be associated with hidden weapons. Well, what I did is I formed teams for each
of the areas and we formally had hypotheses. Half the teams took a hypothesis that it was
there, the other half said it wasn't there and both followed exactly the same method. If you believe it's there, what is the proof
that we'll in fact conform that, prove that hypothesis or what evidence clashes with it. The same thing is true with the teams that
took the hypothesis it wasn't there, is you know, collecting evidence, so yeah you start
with a viewpoint a hypothesis an academic would say and you collect the evidence that
will support or challenge. You tell them, you know, go form and discuss
with your team a hypothesis and get a strategy for doing it and I just, you know, I was unsure
whether they would come back pro or con and I really didn't care and that was intentional
because I didn't want to be seen as stacking the deck and we met every Saturday afternoon
and each team went through a very, almost it was rigorous but almost predictable. You started with here's our hypothesis, here's
what we've done this week, here's how the evidence stacks, here's what we propose to
do the next week and there would be a discussion between the groups and myself over, on each
of them of what they were doing a lot of cross-fertilization. There is a gradual buildup of evidence that
forces you challenge your preexisting belief and it keeps generating either more questions
or generates questions about the hypothesis. For example, I'll give you a real case. One of the first things that worried me was
we had a big army running through Iraq in March and April, WMD was not used against
them nor was it found. That's sort of remarkable if they had large
stockpiles. I really believe in the jungle telegraph,
put the word out on the street. Let people know what your about and what you
have to offer and usually you'll get people coming to you and I had a lot of money, reward
money and I had green cards or passports to virtually any attractive place in the world. You come to us with weapons of mass destruction,
evidence about the weapons and we'll take care of you. All I had coming to me were fabricators, people
who said it but didn't have anything, had absolutely no evidence. Iraq was a horrible place in June, July, August,
September, October, November, insecurity, the economy wasn't working, there was violence,
there's still violence there. It was remarkable to me and disturbing that
in a place this bad who wouldn't want to golden life boat to get out? All they had to do was come with information. I would protect their identity. It was clear to everyone I would take their
whole family. It wasn't a case you have to leave your family
behind, you'll be taken care of but you'll have to find a new family in California, well
some of them might have liked to, but no one bought and so that worried me. Around a weapons program if a weapons program
exists, you're going to find people, people engaged in the production, the technology,
engineering, design; people involved in protecting the weapons, people involved in moving them
and people involved in preparing to use the weapons. We found none of that. We were running into fewer and fewer leads
that looked profitable and a lot of evidence that stacked up to explain something other
than large stockpiles of weapons. I had the habit of writing a personal report
back every weekend which was quite separate than the official reports back saying, you
know, this is what it looks, smells like to me. Here are the issues of the week. Here's how I'm proposing just to, I've always
found that's a good way to keep people informed of what you're doing. I don't think there was a surprise about the
conclusions I was drawing because those were fully, and I think completely and adequately
reported. I think the surprise would be that you would
speak out and say that. I had the privilege, although I didn't always
think it was a privilege, of watching a lot of very senior government officials come to
agonizing terms about Vietnam and decide not to speak out because they knew they'd never
be asked to lunch again. They wouldn't be part of the process and I
just, I think like a lot of people of my age and my generation who were in the government
by no means unique to me just decided that if ever the occasion came, I simply wasn't
going to live like that. There wasn't a lunch or part of process that
was important enough. This committee has a special responsibility
to the men and women of our Armed Forces to look at the prewar intelligence because planning
for military operations is based on intelligence. Policy makers take data, they interpret threat,
they assess risk. You talk about a mushroom cloud, how much
more imminent threat could there be? Why was there skepticism left out of the public
white paper of the CIA? Many of us feel that the evidence so far leads
only to one conclusion, that what has happened was more than a failure of intelligence. It was the result of manipulation of the intelligence
to justify the decision to go to war. Secret societies have their own rules and
secret societies generally don't feel an obligation to openly and democratically communicate. Prime Minister Blair has setup a similar commission
in Great Britain. Yeah. His is going to report back in July. Right. Ours are not going to be until March of 2005,
5 months after the presidential election. Yeah. Shouldn't the American people have the benefit
of the commission before the election? Well, the reason why we gave it time is cause
we didn't want it to be hurried. This is a strategic look, kind of a big picture
look about the intelligence gathering capacities of the United States of America. I think every president should have kept on
their desk the statement, the carved statement that Harry Truman had, ""The Buck Stops Here."" >> If there are no weapons of mass destruction,
which there aren't, if there are no ties with Al-Qaeda, which there weren't and which there
aren't or maybe now there are, then why did we go war? Well, all you need to do is go on the web
and download Project for a New American Century, there you find the ideological and the strategic
underpinnings for this policy which was rejected by George Bush the first which was ridiculed
out of town in those days but became the devout policy of this government and was implemented
starting with the war. I felt in my last year in the Pentagon that
I felt there was a great deal of contempt for the constraints on government that our
constitution lays out and I also felt that there was a contempt for the constitution
and I only absorbed this sense of contempt by association with some of these senior appointed
civilians. Who were all neoconservative, who all believe
in dominance, who believe in preemption, who believe in the military option as the first
resort rather than the last resort. They have had a very fixed indeed almost obsessive
idea that in fact Iraq is a major actor in the world and a probable threat, possibly
a deadly threat to the United States. This is group of people who have essentially
believed that might makes right, that the United States at this stage of history has
unchallengeable power and therefore our responsibility to use it to make the world over in the manner
that we or they how they think it ought to be made over. I think behind the basic neoconservative philosophy
is a considerable arrogance that American interest are the primary goal of all of American
foreign policy. And they seem to have a really serious habit
of not being interested in listening to what other people say about this subject. Now of course American interest should matter
but there are enlightened and unenlightened elements of self-interest and I think in this
case we have determined and defined our interest globally in almost total disregard of what
others states want, what their concerns are, how they might or might not be able to contribute. It's we're on a roll, you're either with us
or get out of the way; I find remarkably little interest in the character of other countries,
the nature of their problems and difficulties. This is boring I think to neoconservatives
who really see this as quite irrelevant what other people, what the political culture of
other societies are, what they want, what their people might want, what some their concerns
might be. It's really quite irrelevant because we know
what we're going to do and get out of the way if you don't agree. They said, look the neocons, we brought down
the evil empire of the Soviet Union and now we're going to bring down Arab nationalism
as personified by Saddam Hussein and Bashar al-Assad and once that happens you're going
to have democracy. You know, the problem is those people have
not set foot, if they've been to the Middle East it's been to Tel Aviv only. No, I don't think it's an accident at all
that so much of the justification turned out to be fallacious, misleading deliberately
so. They thought they had a place in history. They we're going to bring down obviously a
very dysfunctional Arab peninsula, as well as, Iran and they we're going to change history. They believed they won the Cold War and they
said, alright we won the Cold War because we were tough with the Soviet Union, we get
tough with these people and they're going to become like us. It is fair to say that the Iraq War was a
diversion from the war on terrorism. It certainly meant the people weren't paying
as much attention to Afghanistan as they should have and the resources that might have gone
to Afghanistan ended up being focused more in Iraq. If you attack another country with no justification,
people are going to say wait a minute this isn't a war on terrorism, this is a war on
imperialism, this is colonialism, you know, and this is why it's a distraction because
you need the help of these people. You get this view that the CIA and FBI are
lurking around the [inaudible] in the Middle East and handcuffing people or assassinating,
it just doesn't [inaudible] work. You got to have the help of the locals to
identify these people and either put them in jail or remove them from positions where
they can do harm. In January of 2002, as I was sitting in the
bunker of the U.S. Embassy in Cobble, Afghanistan and I and several colleagues were sitting
around one little working TV and low and behold here came the infamous statement of the access
of evil, Iraq, Iran and North Korea and we all looked at ourselves and went, oh my God,
you know, here we are kind of in ground zero of Afghanistan and Washington's talking about
and talking in very belligerent terms about these other 3 countries and we don't have
Afghanistan anywhere close to being settled. The only person Saddam was a threat to at
this point as we saw when the army collapsed, was to Iraq. He didn't have weapons of mass destruction. He wasn't scaring anybody. He certainly wasn't scaring the Iranians or
the Turks or the Saudis or anybody else. It was a state that was on the verge of failure,
now it is a failed state. Failed states cause terrorism, you know, you
can name them Afghanistan, Lebanon, Somalia. Anytime you create a vacuum it's where people
flock to discontented to fight wars. Osama bin Laden had been saying for years,
America wants to invade an Arab country and occupy it, an oil rich Arab country; he had
been saying this, this was part of his propaganda. So, what we do after 9/11? We invade an oil rich and occupy an oil rich
Arab country which was doing nothing to threaten us. The only real connection is that having invaded
Iraq we are very likely to make it a focus of terrorism. We are likely to produce what the president
has said Iraq represents, namely the central battle field in the war on terrorism. Why? Because we sent a lot of Americans into a
place where they're sitting ducks for people who think the only good American is a dead
one. Iraq cannot be govern by Americans, I don't
care what the intention is. I don't care if we truly wanted to build a
democracy. It cannot be ruled by foreign power. We as the one indispensable nation of the
world as we characterize ourselves for so long in the last administration cannot contemplate
that possibly someone else might not like everything we call the American way of life
and that they would in fact welcome us into their countries. This may not be the case. The only tool in the toolbox, the Bush Administration
is military force. Military force is a very blunt instrument,
it just doesn't work. We've created more terrorists in Iraq and
we haven't even solved the problem in Afghanistan. One of the more ironic effects of the attack
on Iraq was to buttress other countries in the conviction of the infamous remark by an
Indian General after the first Gulf War when he said. ""The lesson was war, is that if you have to
fight the United States you better have nuclear weapons."" In some respects, it's as Vietnam didn't even
happen. It's as if a lot of our leaders have suffered
some kind of historical and political lobotomy and that's frightening and every American
should be concerned about that because the United States ultimately is supposed to an
exemplar for the rest of the world. We are supposed to be in Ronald Reagan's words
""That shine city on a hill"" well that shining city is looking kind of slummy right now in
terms of our image abroad and I think with good reason. We violated I think fundamental principles
that have guided this country's foreign policy so successfully since 1947. You don't want your president to be seen as
a hotdog and when your president gets into a jumpsuit and gets in the back of a jet and
lands on an aircraft carrier and then waddles out with his little straps between his legs
and that's not, I mean you want a sign of kind of maturity and not testosterone blasting
through when you're talking about things so fundamentally important as sending a nation
to war and sending young men and women to their deaths. There is a sense in Washington now that you
can't raise objections to this because you're not supporting the troops in the field. I would rapidly point out that unlike almost
anybody I know that hold office in this country, I've had 2 sons in uniform both of whom have
been in combat and so I don't have to take any nonsense from anybody nor will I. Mark Twain's definition of patriotism he says,
""Patriotism is supporting your country all the time and your government when it deserves
it."" Well, I don't think it's patriotic to standby
and remain silent while your country stumbles into disaster. A patriotism is the last refuge of scoundrels
and I think these are scoundrels. They have no argument now. They have no defense for what they did. The country is in a terrible international
security situation that I think is perilous, so they're attacking the patriotism of others. Having been an insider, I know that the insiders
don't have it all right. They make mistakes, indeed [inaudible] and
there's more likely to be misjudgment if there is no criticism. It was Jefferson who said that our kind of
government is not based on trust, it's based in fact suspicion. Supporting the constitution, understanding
what's in the constitution, carrying about the constitution that's why we don't have
a king cause we have a piece of paper, so I think, I think that is a patriotism. It's not just those of us who have been privileged
to serve actually in the government who are the patriots, it's every citizen who respects
and honors the fact that we have such a wonderful country. To suggest that if you have a different viewpoint
than any given administration and/or if you're not supporting the president in policies that
may be highly erroneous. I don't see that as patriotism at all, in
fact, I would argue that any patriot with integrity is going to speak out if he or she
feels that we're on the wrong course. It's not unpatriotic to demand that congress
upholds the constitutional responsibilities regarding the declaration of war, it's not
unpatriotic to be very upset, vocally upset when congress abrogates this constitutional
responsibility be transferring war powers of 40 to the President of the United States
as they did in October of 2002. Listen, when you guys were working NASDAQ.coms
I was out in Iraq trying to get of Saddam and almost got killed for it and besides almost
going to jail, so it doesn't take a whole lot of courage for me to come out against
the war and I did at the beginning but I was studiously ignored. When we did the first Gulf War when I came
of Bagdad in 1991, I met with the President of the United States, I met with the senior
leadership of both parties and the one thing that sticks with me to this day is the extent
to which each one of them explained to me in very emotional terms the extent to which
they had to plum their consciences to come to a decision on how to vote on the use of
force authorization. It had been a moral decision on their part. It had been one that had kept them up at night
as they thought their way through this. We owe our soldiers, our sailors, our airmen
and our marines nothing less before we send them to battle. Sometimes the true patriot takes the unpopular
course but helps their country avoid mistakes and even if they can't persuade at least they
tried. For me, America is this amazing land of opportunity,
beauty of idealism, of hope. It is a beacon to the world. It's a place of fantastic people and what
infuriates me more than anything else is that this administration has systematically slandered,
labeled, blackened the image of America to our friends and allies round the world. Having the authority and the ability to go
and wage war is a very, very solemn thing and it needs to be done with care and with
deliberation and with genuine forethought and I think that none of that was present
in the lead up this entire debacle that we now call enduring freedom. When the emperor has no clothes you have to
have the presence of mind and the courage to stand up and say, ""The emperor has no clothes."" The regime is seeking a nuclear bomb. He has attempted to purchase high-strength
aluminum tubes suitable for nuclear weapons production. Material sufficient to produce more than 38,000
liters of botulin toxin. Saddam Hussein had an advanced Nuclear Weapons
Development program. The British Government has learned that Saddam
Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa. Already, the Kay report identified dozens
of weapons of mass destruction related program activities. ",1
278,well it is a controversial topic on a Toronto University campus this month some people on the campus saying pronouns like he/she him or her do not represent them accurately now the University wants staff to use alternate pronouns but Jordan Peterson is a psychology professor at the University and he is refusing to do that take a look at this reason I'm defending freedom of speech in a civil society  Peterson do you have any comments on the Nazi presence at your protest the presence of Nazis and white supremacists assaulting people at your protest you have any comment on that yeah differences I'm speaking out the way I'm speaking out because I think this is a route to no violence and violence is lurking and you can say that that sounds like a threat it was no violence at our protest oh my gosh ah will you refer to me if it wasn't for this law and I asked you to report me we thought he done perhaps what you had your answer was no note if it helped oh so just an example of how things have become heated at the University of Toronto that's seen showing different groups of students some confronting the professor about his position others supporting him now Peterson says this is about free speech but aw Pete is also a professor at the University of Toronto who says that Peterson's language is abusive joining us right now is professor Jordan Peterson as well as professor awp thank you for joining us today thanks professor Peterson let's begin with you why are you against the use of alternate pronouns I know I'm against the use of legislation to determine what words up that myself and other people are required to utter but would you use alternate pronouns if a student asked you to I think I've made my position on that clear already well perhaps not to our audience at home who are just being introduced to this would you use alternate announced and why not I because I don't believe that other people have the right to determine what language I use especially when it's backed by punitive legislation and when the words that are being required are the constructions there are artificial constructions of people I regard as radical ideologue who's viewpoint I do not share well i we have a graphic to show our audience at home at just some of the pronouns being used or asked to be used as alternates among them you see here Z or Zim Z or here Z or 0 also hey or a rather and per so just some of the alternate pronouns there a professor Pete when you hear professor Peterson saying that this is oppressive how do you respond to that um well the Peterson drama has done real harm to real people on campus he's made it harder to be transgender or non-binary I know this from personal experience I'm non-binary and transgender and I know how it's felt to be on the UFT campus for the last month and I also know from private communications with other effective people you know in New Zealand where I grew up academics have a statutory role and trained in the Education Act to be a critic and conscience of society so I think that's an idea of worth exporting to Canada so I'd like to give Peterson about a B+ for his critic role recently and an F for the conscience part a student once said to me when I finally obtained tenure now professor that now that you have obtained super powers you must agree to use them for good for peace and justice so I invite Peterson to start doing more of that well professor Peterson those who are asking for this alternate use of use of rather of alternate pronouns they are saying it boils down to respecting their human rights how do you respond to that I don't think it boils down to respecting their human rights I think that it's an imposition on freedom of speech that's being implemented at a legislative level I also think that if there was a naturally evolving solution to the linguistic problem that's being posed by a small fraction of the transgender community that people would have already adopted it we've never had a situation we think with in in the usage of English before that required legislation to produce a transformation in the manner in which people spoke has a very dangerous precedent so it's one thing to tell people what they can't say so for example we have legislation making it illegal to do such things as deny the Holocaust it's a completely different thing to demand that people use certain words when they're formulating their own ideas and I mean I can get it's also absurd I mean here's one thing that's happened that I don't believe the formulators of this legislation ever foresaw so in New York City for example there are now 31 protected gender identities and I see no reason whatsoever why each of those gender identities can't demand the use of their own pronoun and that absurd things like that have been happening on the University of Michigan campus for example where students have been given permission to tell faculty members and others what pronouns they're to be addressed by and they're multiplying rapidly out of control so the law is bad from a ethical perspective it's sloppily written and besides that the solution that it imposes is practically untenable well I sorry excuse me for jumping in but I want to bring in professor Pete here because we did show those words to our audience at home and perhaps to the control room can show our audience once again when you look at those alternate pronouns I think it's fair to say that some people will see that at home and see that as very unwieldly if you will what do you say to those types of criticisms including the one you just heard from Professor Peterson um well I'd like to encourage people struggling with us to be kind as their first impulse you know we call somebody what they want to be called in our society for instance I don't call somebody Julie if they prefer to be called daughter that's just basic human courtesy here's a great little tip for people who are despairing at the possibility of remembering some all those pronouns what I do is just program in the pronoun next to the person's name in my smartphone so whenever I'm about out and about and I've forgotten whether one of my trans friends use a Z or zero or they or them or something else I just look it up and it's really super easy one thing I'd like you to really look at in regard to this controversy is to watch out for who's getting centered in a discussion political correctness is code that powerful people use when they're annoyed that they're actually not the center of attention in any given discussion and Bill shocks that c16 is actually not about cisgender people it's about protections for transgender people and that's not you know it's not about Peterson so you know we should have people learning to listen more we have two ears and one mouth for a very good reason when things get political I like to ask who benefits and who gets to decide the rules of the game so you know mostly with this Peterson controversy which is really just a small drama tempest in a teapot you know he could just get over learning to program a few pronouns into his phone by the way I only have half a dozen or so that I actually use on an everyday basis so it's not all that difficult sorry now as we've good job because I think professor Peterson wants to get in on that yeah well kindness is the excuse that social justice warriors use when they want to exercise control over what other people think and say so you know if we're banding back and forth our differences in values you know I would say that the highest possible value is truth and that one of the concomitant is that is that is that we need stringent protection for freedom of speech so that we can utter the truths that we see fit and I think that that's a value that's much higher than than kindness for example I mean there's lots of situations in life where where kindness in the immediate present is not the appropriate way to react at all but so for example when you discipline children you often hurt their feelings in the short term so that they can learn to behave properly in the medium to long term so that their lives go well and so this automatic assumption that the people on the social justice warrior side of the equation are motivated only by kindness when they're also clearly motivated by power is something I find completely untenable and I don't think that Pete's solution to program my cellphone so that I can remember what names people need to be called is a reasonable solution at all we're actually supposed to now use electronic devices to bolster our ability to speak freely how to cases when someone is it so difficult to remember a pronoun you remember somebody's first name you remember their telephone number I mean I think that I don't remember people's names very easily and I don't remember their telephone numbers very easily and when I see a stranger I call them by the pronoun that seems to be in accordance with their presented appearance so that's they appear that way or them that's you being lazy I think there's a very high value that we should also be aiming for in addition to truth by the way through about this whole controversy I have told the truth at every turn so you know trying to imply that that's not what's happening on people on the social justice amaya social justice warrior I don't know but I think that we should be aiming for pluralism this means recognizing more than one set of fundamental principles fostering independent cultural traditions of minorities and being willing to share power with people who are different than you I think if you just stop centering this whole controversy on yourself and how hard it is for you to accommodate genderqueer people well have a little bit of sympathy I mean those of us who are trans encounter much more greater and dignities every day and every week of the month for example have you recently had a bank employee accuse you of trying to masquerade as yourself at a bank and then locking down your ATM card and credit cards so that you can't use any money those are the sorts of problems that trans people face every day being out of housing being considered you know considering suicide these are really big problems my refusal to pronet to use pronouns because left-wing activists want me to use them has nothing to do with whether or not trans people are having difficulties in society and I'd also like to point out that I've had many letters of support I've had many letters of support from trans people and they tell me that the trans the trans activists don't support them and most trans people actually wanted to be referred to as he or she doesn't mean they were my friends I'm transphobic they were to know a few people just because you've told I didn't you know those people you you don't know the trans community like the trans community does you've got no idea what the trans offense rÃ¡pida trends professor I'm sorry to interrupt let's let's let Professor Peterson finish his thought please all right so the trans activists aren't aren't proper representatives of the trans community because they haven't been elected by the trans community there are the other noises in the Jordan I'm not speaking for anyone except myself and on behalf of other people perhaps who want to use who want to maintain the right to free speech I'm not claiming that I'm a representative of white people or white man or any other group I'm speaking on behalf of myself and so I'm not taking but no sir professor Peter so let me jump in there though because we have seen an evolution of language there are words that we don't use non-white legislation well legislation or not are words that have evolved we don't use for example I'm Asian I would bristle someone called me oriental that is an evolution of how we use words how is this different weather legislated or not was great iron registration I just know it said if I understand legislatively but if at the heart of it is to allow a student to study free of what they feel is discrimination why not help that along I already made my case for why not help that alone I believe that this legislation is extraordinarily dangerous and there's other elements of it too that we haven't even got to in our society yet like the protection for gender expression and I've looked at gender expression in the Ontario Human Rights Code and as far as I can tell gender expression is best summarized in a single word fashion because it's the way that you present yourself in in public with your clothing in your manner of dress and so I also think that the legislation that we are bringing forth with bill c16 and that's already in place in places like Ontario also makes deposit makes fashion criticism something akin to a hate crime and because there's been so much noise about the identity component of this we haven't even talked about gender expression this is appalling legislation and the idea that referring to someone by the pronoun of their choice is going to radically improve their status in society or their mental health is a completely unproven assumption I think it'll have exactly the opposite effect professor when I professor Pete I want to ask you because it's been brought up a couple of times too professor Peterson's point if the what this was so popular if this was so needed there would be a natural evolution there wouldn't be need for legislation why the need for for legislating this as opposed to allowing it to evolve naturally well bill sixteen C sixteen and the Ontario Human Rights Code do not actually legislate pronoun usage they don't specify thirty one genders or anything of the kind but let me jump in though the university is essentially telling at this point it's human human resources people to use alternate pronouns in a way legislating their staff to do this no way the legislation or the legislation also requires the university made clear their concordance with that that assumption on my part by mentioning in the letter that asked me to silence myself that I'm required to act in in accordance with the provisions of the Ontario Human Rights Act and so the University no full well that the legislation does precisely what I suggest it does it's not written precisely in bill C 16 it's written in the Ontario Human Rights Code and if you read the Ontario Human Rights Commission policies on such things you'll see very rapidly that utilization of preferred pronouns is part of the legislative package so that's just excellent is region to slash in Jordan you will find out that they're actually called correct pronouns there's there's no preference about this there is no material there is any on terrorism there is on the Ontario Human Rights Commission website where the policies laid out and if people don't believe that they can just go look themselves professor Peet when you hear that this is a free speech issue that you hear professor Peterson in this case essentially saying that he doesn't want to be legislated to adopt new language what's your response to that well I share a number of Jordans concerns about freedom of speech and academic freedom on campus these are both very very important principles and they should apply regardless of what kind of politics you like for example if you're a left winger or a right winner or an up when you're a down winner or whatever it is but you know the reason why we have laws that protect academic freedom and freedom of speech is primarily to prevent government interference in individuals lives in their business it's they're really mostly to protect against a form of structural violence and they were these these free speech laws were actually never intended to be used as all purpose accountability shields you know so that you don't have to be held accountable for your actions I'm perfectly willing to be held accountable for my actions and the university has already indicated the seriousness with which they view my actions and I also do not believe that free speech laws were there to protect to to regulate violence free speech laws are there because we use free speech to identify problems in our society generate solutions to the problems and then reach a consensus so freedom of speech is actually that is is protection for the mechanism by which our individuals and society properly orient themselves across time it's not it's not even a principle it's the fundamental method by which our societies manage to maintain the stability that they do maintain and so on it's one of the ways we do that yes well I would say that it's the fundamental way so and I mean I think we could have a reasonable discussion about that but because freedom of speech is so tightly tangled up with with our the means by which we solve problems I mean I think you know and then I talk but I get corrected when I speak publicly and the fact that I'm being corrected constantly by the people that I'm speaking with helps orient my speech properly and helps orient public discussion properly and and I can tell you too that if there wasn't something absolutely vital at stake here that had a lot more to do more than to do than with just simple kindness there wouldn't have been millions of people watching for example the assault that took place during the free speech rally that was held a few days after I released the video which I see that CBC conveniently omitted to include in their video clips at the beginning of this interview well professor Peterson we would do we do want to thank you or sorry we're at a time here but I want to thank both of you for joining us today that is the University of Toronto professors Jordan Peterson and aw Pete talking about what has become a very big controversy at the University of Toronto and beyond,1
189,so you're the heads of china once one of the greatest empires in the world but in the late 1800s and early 1900s you hit a rough patch [Music] china was defeated and pillaged by the british the french japan russia basically china an empire that very much values honor respect was put to shame on the world stage for over a hundred years it was so bad that china would later call it the century of humiliation if that wasn't bad enough china also had a few more rough patches after that with around 18 to 45 million deaths during a movement they called the great leap forward and around another 20 million deaths during the movement after that called the cultural revolution because of all the shame and disgrace you've grown to resent not just the west but the rest of the east the north the south and everyone in between you long for the days when you were number one when you were on top of the world but don't take my word for it take the word from all these chinese officials that regularly spout this china has become a global leader in terms of composite national strength and international influence and the worst part is that you could easily be number one if it wasn't for those milling americans that believe in democracy natural rights and other dangerous ideas like freedom of speech ideas that if your populist gets a whiff of it would be the end of your rule because of these ideas and the fact that america is the only one standing in your way for world domination this automatically makes them public enemy number one throughout human history all the way up to the 1900s to defeat an enemy state you simply go to war but as we've seen with our 100 years of shame traditional warfare hasn't been our strong suit for a while but it is for those despicable americans even though the americans didn't really win in the middle east or vietnam or korea their traditional forces of soldiers tanks and aircraft are a force to be reckoned with while having actual combat experience so you put your pride away and objectively realize that it's far from guaranteed that you could win a head-to-head boots on the ground war with the us we need a new plan of attack a new way to wage war where we don't have to go head first into america's greatest strength and our greatest weakness following our great sun zeus art of war if you're gonna attack your enemy attack him where he can't defend luckily for you times have changed the modern day battlefield is no longer fought with bullets but with ones and zeroes dollars and cents sure there will always be a time for conventional warfare but today instead of storming the desert it's storming the enemy's walls by attracting foreign investors money and not letting that money ever leave your country instead of killing soldiers it's by baiting companies that outsource their workers for dirt cheap labor thereby taking away jobs from the enemy country killing their morale and making them more dependent on you instead of fighting on the european front or the pacific front it's fighting on the economic front the social front instead of deploying troops it's deploying cyber warfare troops that sit behind a computer screen instead of invading and occupying smaller nations it's offering them irresistible loans to build infrastructure projects and taking them over once they can't pay it back war is no longer using force to compel your enemy to your will but rather by using all means armed and unarmed force lethal and non-lethal force by doing whatever it takes and you want to know what the best part is is that while all these revolutionary changes are happening to the battlefield your arch nemesis the u.s are still spending away all their resources building up their conventional forces thinking that they have the most powerful military leaving them with no resources are desired to invest into the real domains the cyber and economic ones but can you really blame them the traditional military industrial complex and defense contracts make a lot of money so lucky for us why would they want to change that's not our job the us military leaders say so like everything else their government does they keep kicking the can down the road like sun tzu said if your opponent doesn't even know they're at war well they've already lost this is that strategy we're at war only it's not being fought by guns and missiles not yet at least it's a war of perception the greatest long-term threat to our nation's information and intellectual property and to our economic vitality is the counterintelligence and economic espionage threat from china that i think it's the most consequential existential threat not just to america just to democracy the world's ever seen but if you think these issues are just an intelligence issue or a government problem or a nuisance largely just for big corporations who can largely take care of themselves you could not be more wrong it's the people of the united states who are the victims of what amounts to chinese theft on a scale so massive that it represents one of the largest transfers of wealth in human history [Music] war combat it's all about deception you make the enemy think you're gonna come out from one corner to shoot but then boom you come out of the other corner and blow them to bits the modern battlefield is no different you make the west believe that you support free trade and globalization while systematically taking advantage of it you tell other countries like the us to say no to protectionism to tariffs well that's literally your entire strategy you waive the carrot of short-term profits in front of your enemies that are drooling at the mouth while using their money to fund your rise to number one china has a fundamentally different system than ours and it's doing all it can to exploit the openness of ours while taking advantage of its own closed system and at the core china's main strategy and advantage over the us is just that the ability to think in decades and centuries instead of quarterly earnings reports or the next election cycle china has a vision a big why a purpose to guide them through all the short-term pain in their journey to world domination with absolute power over their subjects to back it up the u.s on the other hand have grown weak and comfortable from nearly a hundred years of opulence and much like how a spoiled child can never work hard america's prosperity and freedom will be its own downfall they're not willing to give up their comforts to fight a bigger enemy and their government has hardly any control over their own citizens think of china kinda like the old robber barons like rockefeller or jp morgan but at a global level we can use every single dirty trick in the book to crush our competitors the chinese government is engaged in a broad diverse campaign of theft and malign influence and it can execute that campaign with authoritarian efficiency they're calculating they're persistent they're patient and they're not subject to the righteous constraints of an open democratic society or the rule of law every war has different fronts that must be fought in world war ii it was the european front and the asia pacific front for this new cold war there are many different fronts where one of the most important being the economic front china saw how money turned the u.s into a global superpower and how micromanaging everything destroyed the soviet union so china took the best of both worlds they combined the absolute authoritarianism they needed to stay in power but sprinkled on some capitalism to make the money they would need to dominate the world or in other words we realize that money talks on the global stage so we align private profit with national interests china has complete control over the economy so we can do whatever it takes to make sure the right companies succeed in the direction we want and yet we've created one of the freest environments to do business there's no pesky things like the epa better business bureau intellectual property rights and yet the government has the final say on all matters if they think your company is better suited merged with this other company they'll take your company and assets by force and merge it with the other an awful lot of large chinese businesses are state-owned enterprises literally owned by the government and thus the party and even if they aren't china's laws allow its government to compel any chinese company to provide any information it requests including american citizens data on top of that chinese companies of any real size are legally required to have communist party cells inside them to keep them in line the equivalent to the us government forcing apple to have a u.s representative on their board of directors to make sure everything is going according to plan competition among chinese is extremely dog-eat-dog and yet important companies get cash injections and are backed by the government because of this close economy we're able to pull off some very clever tricks that get us ever so closer to world domination one of our greatest tactics is the fact that when foreign investors put money into our country no matter how much money they earn on paper they can never pull it out of the here's how it works number one we attract foreign businesses investors banks hedge funds many of them from the us to invest billions upon billions of dollars over the years into chinese real estate businesses stocks which is not very hard given that we have the biggest population and the biggest new market to make money in number two the investors money is used to make our economy the fastest growing in history while preventing that same money from being used to grow america's economy number three the investors see their money grow on paper which makes them really happy and attracts more investors and number four when investors want to take their earnings out and convert it into let's say usd they can't why because this is our closed economy you have to follow our rules if you want to play and our rule is is that we need this money to stay within our borders to keep funding our astronomical growth as long as more money keeps coming into china unless it's going out all is going according to plan sure with the right person applying the right pressure money can go out of china but for the average foreign firm like chevron sony x on these suckers have had their money trapped here since 2015. now if you're sitting there with your hands stroking your chin wondering this this kind of sounds like a ponzi scheme where investors put money in and their money is used as returns for the investor that came in before them no well i'll let you guys be the judge of that and if you think that trick was clever you have seen nothing yet see every country's currency's value is determined by traders on foreign exchange markets but who says that's how it has to work if we put our un on the market we'd completely lose control over it so the un isn't traded on foreign exchange markets everything happens within our borders its value is whatever we say it is china has printed 30 trillion dollars worth of rmb in a decade like the scale to which they've printed is again it's unprecedented can the chinese run their stock market up absolutely domestically they control the price they control the printing press they control the police they control the narrative and there are many other tricks up our sleeves forcing foreign companies to give up the trade secrets to do business in china when no other nations do that to chinese firms stealing anywhere from two to three trillion dollars worth of intellectual property from the us over the past 10 years and selling it back to them at a discount they all estimate that that number's 200 to 300 billion dollars worth of ip per year there's a return on that annually as well so over the last decade they've stolen you know two to three trillion uh in ip from us we've now reached the point where the fbi is opening a new china-related counterintelligence case about every 10 hours of the nearly 5 000 active fbi counterintelligence cases currently underway across the country almost half are all related to china not allowing western social platforms like google facebook youtube and our economy so we can control the narrative while the west allows all of our government-controlled social platforms into their nation so we can influence their narrative getting us companies to outsource 3.7 million manufacturing jobs to our very poor cheap laborers since 2001 pummeling their middle class even more forcing u.s companies not to spread ideas we don't like like disney hollywood the nba marriott and more all this economic warfare is for one purpose to fund our meteoric rise as the fastest growing economy in history with everyone else's money while fooling everyone into thinking that we're playing by the worlds and that yes you should definitely keep treating us fairly even though we're not treating you fairly and all this economic power allows us to move on to the other fronts of this new cold war like the all too insidious infrastructure fronts infrastructure is one of the most important aspects of a society it is literally the underlying foundation of a country infrastructure also happens to be one of those things that is taken for granted by the populace people in the u.s typically don't go about their dates wondering hey how secure are gas pipelines or electricity grids or who controls the shipping ports and container ships where 90 of our goods travel on [Music] yet if just one of these systems went out it would lead to some catastrophic events that's why in china we understand just how important infrastructure warfare is in our ever more connected world that's why we have a laser focused on infrastructure both domestically and internationally within china we're focused on making our economy completely independent from the outside world where we're not dependent on exports or imports an economy that isn't fragile to the goodwill of others like how every nation including china is right now this is where ghost cities come into play to create this insulated economy china started building entire cities 120 in total each designed to hold between 5 to 10 million people that's why in just two years from 2012 to 2014 china poured more concrete than the us did in the last 100 years because these cities were built ahead of demand there are 50 ghost cities in china 50 cities ranging from twice the size of philadelphia to the size of new york without a soul to be seen and guess what china's plan for an independent super economy was funded by you guessed it the west headed by wall street who probably aren't going to get their money back and every cent of this construction went straight into china's record-breaking gdp numbers so that begs the question if there are 64 million vacant apartments on the market and even more vacant business space in the billions of square feet it would only make sense that real estate prices should have already crashed in china right well no as we learn in the economic front china controls the entire economy including real estate and prices so we simply prevent this new real estate from being sold see what westerners don't understand is that economic growth is very easy if you control everything while we're making our infrastructure more robust at home naturally we're focused on making everyone else's infrastructure more fragile abroad this is where the belt and road initiative or bri comes in a plan to connect nearly 70 nations many of them poor desperate emerging nations around the world by road rail air and most importantly by sea and here's how it works number one find nations with resources we need whether that be cheap labor mined or important locations number two approach these desperate nations with a smile and say that in the name of facilitating free trade and harmony peace and prosperity we'll give you a loan that we know you can't pay back to build infrastructure projects like a seaport to build up your economy and will just collect interest in return a no-brainer deal you'd be crazy to pass it up and then boom step number three once you drown the country in debt it's basically yours and from here you can do whatever you want in the case of the very strategic port of sri lanka when they couldn't make the payments they just gave it back to china with even more land on top of that in the case of africa you can keep milking the resources and cementing your influence and control as these nations start to prosper you can sell to them collect their data and further your influence and all these locations that are practically ours are more avenues for us to send conventional military troops through if that time ever comes more on that later if you want to learn more about this modern day colonialism check out our video called the profitable business of enslaving third world countries along with domestic infrastructure and the bri the last and most important piece of the infrastructure front is 5g [Music] now if you're looking for 5g conspiracy theories go watch some other video because we don't even have to go into that kind of speculation 5g is not just another phone network sure it gives consumers up to 100 times faster speed but for the most part consumers won't be able to take advantage of all that extra juice the real game changer is that this extra speed and bandwidth will make way for a new generation of society built around devices connected to each other whereas 4g only allows around 6 500 devices per square mile 5g can support up to a million devices per square mile this extra capacity means that every aspect of a society's infrastructure planes trains machinery self-driving cars smart homes connected healthcare agriculture cameras the military will be able to communicate with each other over a 5g network more data being collected means that more data can be funneled into ai and machine learning algorithms at an even faster rate and if you thought technology was already moving fast if the highway data travels on gets supercharged the pace of technology will increase at an even more incomprehensible rates we already talked about how fragile nations are to the infrastructure so if the future of infrastructure is powered over 5g networks if one were to control said 5g networks one could theoretically have the keys not to just the kingdom but to the entire modern world including all of one's enemies in our modern world there is perhaps no more ominous prospect than a hostile foreign government's ability to compromise our country's infrastructures and devices if one controlled all 5g networks one could theoretically view all the world's data traveling on those super highways including business plans military plans academic papers engineering plans surveillance camera feeds anything and everything sent over 5g one could also turn off aspects of a nation's infrastructure at will one could collect and feed everyone's data into one's own ai algorithms like one is already doing with the government controlled social media platforms or in other words if china is gonna get back to its glory days on the world stage it would be very advantageous of us to take the same approach we're doing with the belt and road initiative generously offered to build a 5g networks for other nations out of our own goodwill of course but you gotta keep this part extra secret because other countries are starting to catch on to our intentions like japan australia and the uk india those middling americans of course and maybe even the eu if we don't act fast if chinese companies like huawei are given unfettered access to our telecommunications infrastructure they could collect any of your information that traverses their devices or networks worse still they'd have no choice but to hand it over to the chinese government if asked the privacy and due process protections that are sacrosanct in the united states are simply non-existent in china there are many other fronts in this new cold war that we don't have time to get into the cyber warfare front the technology front the social front but there's one more friend worth mentioning an under the radar return to the conventional military fronts as we mentioned in the beginning of this video as long as we're not guaranteed to win the conventional war with the us we'll keep fighting on the more subtle modern day battlefield but china isn't dumb we know that conventional warfare will never go away and that someday we might just have to participate in it and as the west has been funding our rise we've been investing a lot of that money not just a normal infrastructure like we already talked about but also into our military so if or when that time ever comes we can strike china already has more warships than the u.s navy while the u.s has been lowering its icbm count due to international agreements we've been stockpiling hours and regularly show them off and a healthy amount of us military components and raw materials come straight from china the propellant that fires their missiles materials for their night vision goggles their entire telecom system their computers they're entirely dependent on us so for now we'll just keep selling war materials to the americans build up our own power and control and then strike if the time comes so you know that war is all about deception not just conventional fighting you know about our economic front the business front all the different infrastructure fronts at home and abroad and how we're gearing up our conventional fronts so the question remains who's gonna win this new cold war well if the west keeps fighting each other about systematic racism while the concept of racial discrimination doesn't even exist in china with this very own concentration camps and cattle cars mind you if the west keeps calling a certain president a tyrant when there's an actual authoritarian regime a few thousand miles off the coast of california that makes the certain president look like gandhi if consumers keep buying chinese plastic just to save a buck well they better start learning mandarin and let's just calm down and put this [Music] okay confronting this threat effectively does not mean we shouldn't do business with the chinese does not mean we shouldn't host chinese visitors it does not mean we shouldn't welcome chinese students or co-exist with china on the world stage but it does mean that when china violates our criminal laws and international norms we are not going to tolerate it much less enable it the fbi and our partners throughout the u.s government will hold china accountable and protect our nation's innovation ideas and way of life with the help and vigilance of the american people thank you for having me here today speaking of learning mandarin check out today's video sponsor um i mean we don't have a sponsor because not many brands are willing to support this video economic warfare at its finest so i tell you what if you want to support this channel financially and you want more videos like this one check out a course i made on how to land a remote job this is how i got my start and this whole make money online thing with a 40 per hour remote web dev job and i believe it's the most practical way for others to get started as well you don't have to start a business from scratch you learn valuable skills on your own time while making consistent money so you're not starving to death and as we've seen in recent times remote jobs are a lot less fragile than traditional ones and my favorite part is that you can use remote jobs as a jumping off point for whatever you want you can use the extra time to work on a side business like i did or you can be a digital nomad traveling the world which a lot of people do with their remote jobs as well and with this course it walks you through what jobs to go after based on your personality what the best route to learn it are standing out when applying to jobs and interviews and basically everything you need from start to finish and you can start your remote journey right now for a very reasonable price and support this channel at the same time with the link below gentle reminder that i have partnered up with the chinese communist party and for every single time you guys watch a video leave a comment leave a like subscribe turn on the notification bell your social credit score will go up by one point so get that social credit score up before you get thrown into a concentration camp i mean a re-education gap nobody here is a criminal no sir okay gentlemen sorry we couldn't work anything out but uh i'm gonna go home and pay my taxes highly highly recommend you guys read the book that this video is based on called stuff for how china took over while america's elite slept by brigader general robert spalding from what i understand brigader general is like one of the highest ranks in the military so this guy he knows what he's talking about it's not that long or a hard read and it goes over like a ton of stuff that i didn't have time to cover in this video also i see you guys backing me up in the warzone that is the comment section this is turning out to be like a real mafia where you like defend the godfather so you know don tran really appreciates it and i want you to know that i see you and i really appreciate you all right you can follow me on instagram at jaketrend.io for like behind the scenes stuff uh teasers random

491,"- Is it straight? - Oh, now, yeah! - Do you need to fix the part? - Okay, got it. - Okay right. - What's up? I'm Jesse from KARATEbyJesse.com, aka The Karate Nerd, and today I am joined by the one and only Sensei Bill ""Superfoot"" Wallace. Thank you so much Sensei for joining us today. - Thank you sir, my pleasure. - So, what many people might not know is that you were actually the commentator of the very first UFC fightl. - Yes Could you take us there, bring us behind the scenes and tell us what actually went on in the early beginnings of the UFC. - What happened is Rorion Gracie, the father, calls me up and he says, ""Bill, we would like you to commentate at ""our first, you know, fighting championships."" - Yeah. - And I went, ""Whoa, well, yeah I could do that, no problem. ""I don\'t think it\'s gonna go well, ""because the martial artists are not in, ""they like the kickboxing part of it, ""but they didn\'t like the grappling part of it, ""and so sure, I\'ll do that, ""\'cause you\'re paying me a lot of money."" - Okay, yeah. - So, I go and I show up, I'm with Jim Brown, the American Football player, and Kathy Long, who was also a lady kickboxer. - Yeah. - So, we're sittin' there, we're going over it, now, there's no pre runs or anything, we're just, I get there on Friday and the thing happens on Saturday. So they have the meeting and there are no rules, the two rules were: you can't stick your fingers in a guys' eye and you can't kick him in the groin. - Right. - That's the two rules. I went, okay. - Interesting. - Yup yup. And, the participants could not wear hand wraps. - No. - Could not wear leg wraps, and just like it was. They had to wear a mouthpiece 'cause-- - Okay. - It protects the teeth. - Groin cup? - Yeah. - Okay. - And when the fights happened, I'd have a guy sitting beside me, from the Gracie Jiu-jitsu, telling me what to say about the Gracie's. - Oh right. - So it's to push the Gracie's. So basically I'm thinking oh, something doesn't sound right here. Seems to me like it's a two hour advertisement for Gracie Jiu-Jitsu, which is what it turned out to be. I mean, Royce did a fantastic job, don't get me wrong, He didn't punch anybody, - No. - He didn't kick anybody, - No. - He just got 'em down, took 'em down with a double every time was a double leg takedown, and he choked 'em out. - No one barged, choked all of 'em out. And the first time I said, ""Okay,"" and I think it was Royce's second match against Ken Shamrock. - Yeah. - They're fighting and Ken Shamrock jumped in for a double leg takedown. - Yeah. - And Royce reaches under his belt and grabs his own belt. - Right. - And chokes Ken Shamrock out. - Okay. - Ken Shamrock chokes. - Yeah, yeah. - Taps out. They get up, ""You can\'t do that, you can\'t do that!"" and finding out was Ken Shamrock accused him, which is rightfully so, - Yeah. - That you can't reach under, grab the belt, - Okay. - And choke me out with your own belt. - Yeah. - Well yes you can because, as we know in martial arts training, - Yeah. - Our uniform is also a weapon. - Right, so that was allowed according to the rules? - Yeah, Ken Shamrock wasn't for it, he was upset. - Right. - But he lost. - Right. - And then, you know, then Royce just went through their belts, choking everybody out. - Right. - Behind him, choke out. - Yeah. - But just, you know, choking out. - Exactly. So are you saying they kind of organized this thing? I don't want to say it's a conspiracy theory but-- - No it wasn't, it just-- - Was it like a marketing stunt, almost? - I guess you could say that. - For the Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu system? - Oh sure. - Yeah. - 'Cause they pick the fighters. - Oh really? - Rorion Gracie picked the fighters. - So they probably picked fighters that would look good against Brazilian. - Of course they would. - Because you've got the stand-up, the hands are here. - Right. - How easy now is it for you to drop down into your double leg takedown? - Double, yeah. - 'Cause they've never seen it before. - They had never seen that takedown before. - They're stand-up fighters. - Exactly. - So they have no idea how to even react to it. The boxer didn't even throw a punch. (Jesse laughs) The boxer never threw a punch. - They're just shooting for the double leg. - (mumbles) Took him down and that was it. And what I don't understand too is that they had a big sumo wrestler. - Oh yeah, right. - Excuse me. (Jesse laughs) What's the job of a sumo wrestler? To push you out of a circle about this size. - Right. - I push you out, I win. He doesn't know how to strike. - No. - He doesn't know how to kick. - No. - He doesn't know how to choke or arm bar, he just pushed you out of a ring. It's a closed ring, you can't get out of there. - Right. - So what are you gonna do, push him against a wall until he suffocates or something? (Jesse laughs) And I'm sure that's what he wanted to do, get him down, lay on top of him. - Yeah, yeah. - So what happens is this kid from the Netherlands. - Yeah. - Just nails him. He comes in (mumbles) the guy drops down to his knees. - Yeah. - And the guy from the Netherlands, I can't remember his name, just nails him right in the face with a roundhouse kick. - Right. - And a tooth goes flying over my head. - Oh! - I went (mumbles) then he steps down and the kid's still sitting there. Punches him right in the mouth. Now, the kid from the Netherlands broke his foot, - Really? - And then broke his hand on the kid's face. - Oh! - But they stopped the match. - Yeah. - Now, I don't know why because he wasn't hurt, bleeding a little bit, but he wasn't hurt. The guy was 350 or should be 400 and something pounds. Hell, this guy is like a log! (Jesse chuckles) So he wasn\'t hurt, he said, ""Why are you stopping the fight? ""Why are you stopping?"" Only because he knocked a tooth out. But he was okay. - Yeah. - So there's another conspiracy. - Right. - Because now you're saying, just a minute. - Right. - If this guy can hit this guy with his best shot, two best shots, and nothing happened, what happened? How's Royce gonna take him down? - Oh! - Royce is gonna get dropped down for the double leg. - Yeah. - Or he just fans out on his back. (choking noises) Now he, Royce is on his stomach flattened out, this guy is going. - Yeah. (choking noises) - So they wanted him out? - Sure. - Yeah. - And then one of the guys who was a really good boxer, really good puncher, asked him not to use the smoke because he had asthma. - Okay. - So they used the smoke anyway. We're coming out there, 'bout halfway through the match (heaving noises) - Oh, so like smoke machines? - Sure. They go, now hold on just a minute. (Jesse laughs) What the hell's going on here? (stutters) So there's eight guys, which means there's seven fights. - Yeah. - Right. Four, two, then one right? - Right. - And you go, okay what the heck's going on here? But I never thought it would be as popular as it was. - No? - No, I never did. - How come? - Because the first time I saw it I didn't like it. - No? - The first time I saw it I said, ""What, that\'s bull!"" Because, number one, Royce never threw a kick. He threw one kick to keep the guy away from him. Never threw a punch, just standing there like this. Drops down, and Gracie was the only one, the only one that was allowed to wear a uniform. The other guys couldn't even wrap their hands, but he was allowed to go in the uniform. - So when they couldn't wrap their hands, they can barely punch full contact? - Exactly. And you got guys that, because you're, ""Oh I want to wrap my knees."" ""No you can\'t wrap your knees."" But Royce is allowed to wear all that stuff, yes. So, you go, hold on, what, I don't understand this. And I think the reason I wasn't invited back, one of the reasons because there are several-- - Oh, so you were not invited back? - No. I asked too many questions. (Jesse laughs) I said: ""Why don\'t you have a regular wrestler there?"" A wrestler that knows how to defend against-- - Oh, there was no wrestler? - Nope. There was six strikers, strikers, Royce and the sumo wrestler. - So it sounds to me like it was basically set up for a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioner. - Yeah, I mean don't get me wrong, they all had their chance to win. - Sure. - But Royce knows how to defend that. But this is 1993. - And they didn't know how to defend that. - They didn't know how to defend against a takedown. Even though you say, ""Well I\'ve practiced,"" no you haven\'t. Not against a guy that knows how to do the takedown. - Yeah, exactly. - So, Royce was the reason, the first one he won, the second one he won, the third one where they changed the rules a little bit because the time, it was taking too long. - Ah, I see. - And on the third one he had the Grand Championship Master between Ken Shamrock and Royce, rematch it might say. Shamrock shot him with a punch right here, split him wide open, but it didn't do anything, all it did was cut him and so they finally called it a draw because it was ... - But that's how Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu became so famous! Because it looked so effective. - Well, they keep saying most fights end up on the ground. - Yeah, I hear that all the time. - Well all fights start standing up. - That's true. - All fights start standing, so if I stand up and I'm from me to her, she's gotta come close to me before she can do anything, before she can punch me, before she can kick me, before she can do a takedown, right? - Exactly. - That gives me the chance to counter. Well, they're not used to that because if I'm standing right here and I do this, you've got to put your hands up and I drop ready for the double leg. That's what they do and the stand-up fighters, naive, that they are, they say, ""Well when he stops ""then I\'ll just punch him in the mouth."" No you won't, because I'll do this first. You put your hands up and then I'll drop down. - Yeah, exactly. Well it worked very well because now Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is one of the world's largest, most popular martial arts. - But what did they have to do? They had to learn to strike. Because remember, we learned how to defend against it. - Exactly. - So they had to learn how to strike to get in there. - Especially against a wrestler who knows the double leg takedown, who knows the defense. - In wrestling the double leg is the first takedown you're taught. It's also the first takedown you learn to defend. - Imagine if a wrestler had been invited to the first UFC. - Imagine that, imagine. - And if that wrestler knew a little bit of striking so he could do ground and pound, for example. - Imagine that. - Maybe the whole martial arts world would look different. - Imagine that. (Jesse laughs) - Wow. - They're in the process now of even trying to get rid of wrestling in the Olympics. - Oh is that so? - Yeah. It was the very first one, it was in the very first Olympics back in somebody AD. So think about this. If they want to get rid of wrestling, then how many people will not be using wrestling techniques but the Gracie's still will. - Exactly. So you could say they have something of an unfair advantage. - Well, no, they know what they're doing. They know how to work the chokes, they know how to work the arm bars, they know how to work, most of them now have learnt the striking aspect of it. - Yeah, exactly. - The speed aspect of it. - And they manage to combine that. - And they don't mind you taking them down because now even though you're on top I'm in the on guard position to where I've got my legs wrapped around you and pretty soon you get frustrated, you reach, I get the arm. You reach, I get the neck. (background shouting) (Jesse chuckles) So what happens is UFC now. - Exactly. So what do you think, looking at the first UFC to all the way, looking at the evolution of it, comparing that to today. - Oh it's 100% different. - It is? - Sure. Because the rules have changed. Now there are rules, before there were none, remember? Now, it's a funny thing, that if I'm on the ground I can kick you in the face but you can't kick me at all. - Exactly. (chuckles) - You can't punch me in the back of the head. Why? - One might argue that those rules favor a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioner. - Shame on you Jesse! (Jesse laughs) You shouldn't talk like that, but again it's the, and I hate to use the term sport of it, you know. I mean, it's like two gladiators out there fighting. Except this time, hopefully, the loser doesn't die. - Exactly, yeah. - I don't like to watch it because I hate that term ground and pound. Think about it, ground and pound, what does that say to you? You get a guy on the ground, you beat him until he says: ""I quit."" Well, that doesn't even happen out on the street. There's gonna be somebody who's gonna pull you off. I don't know, just me, I like to kick people. (laughter) - All right, thank you so much Sensei. - Thank you. - For sharing that amazing...",1

294,"If it’s Thursday, old conspiracy theories
gain new steam. President Trump tweeting another conspiracy theory. Baseless allegation that former President
Obama wiretapped him during a 2016 campaign. Once in the margins of politics, today, conspiracy
theories are headline news. Clinton has Parkinson’s Disease, Clinton
has ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. If the Russians are attacking our election in order to elect Trump, they’re not going to do that for free. A conspiracy theory can spread faster 
than it ever could before, because it goes like a flash on social media. With 9/11, the whole thing is a black hole of lies. Some conspiracy theories have become part
of our national psyche. More and more Americans, according to the
polls, have become convinced they haven’t been told the whole truth about the Kennedy
assassination. There’s nothing quite like the Kennedy assassination,
I think, in the realm of conspiracy theory. What can this seminal moment in American history
tell us about the grip of the new breed of conspiracy theories 
we’re seeing today? From Dallas, Texas, the flash apparently official: President Kennedy died at 1 p.m. Central Standard Time, 2:00 Eastern Standard Time, some 38 minutes ago. The conspiracy theories - they actually began
exploding almost from the moment it was officially announced that the president was dead. All kinds of rumors were spreading that the Soviets might have done it, the Cubans might have done it. It was the anti-Castro Cubans. 
It was the FBI, it was the Mafia. Bobby Kennedy will ask the head of the CIA, 
“Did you kill my brother?” In other words, 
a coup d’etat as opposed to a lone gunman. Almost every aspect of the assassination 
was under dispute. From where the gunshots came from,
 to the number of shooters involved. I definitely saw the man shooting from the knoll. It was on the 6th floor. My book shows quite conclusively that shots came from at least two directions. The JFK conspiracy theories arose 
out of a spectacular crime that occurred under very suspicious circumstances. Jefferson Morley has been studying the Kennedy
assassination for 30 years. He says the questions mounted when the main suspect, Lee Harvey Oswald, was killed in custody. And the concerns escalated when the government
released the findings of its official investigation. Today, the Warren Report attempts to unravel the dark twists into which the national tragedy was thrown. So the Warren Commission investigated and then they put out this report, not a particularly
convincing account of the crime. They’ve sealed away some of the evidence and I think that’s rather disturbing to most people. Why did Oswald do this? The Warren Commission never came up with a motive. Why would he do it? People said, ""No, the government’s explanation 
doesn’t make sense,"" and they began to look for other ways to explain it and so they came up with conspiracy theories. For many, the proof of conspiracy was confirmed when they saw an amateur home movie taken
by a Dallas businessman. The most dramatic and most important single
piece of evidence of the assassination was provided by Mr. Abraham Zapruder on one roll
of 8 mm color film, Mr. Zapruder had the astonishing luck to capture the entire assassination. When people saw the film – and anyone who sees the film I think can agree, that when you first see it, it looks like the president must have been shot in the front of the head
because his head is thrown violently backwards. The Warren Commission said the president was
hit in the rear of the head. That basic conflict led people to assume that there was a second
shooter, evidence of a conspiracy that has been covered up by the government. And that
really is the main gist of an argument that has now been going on for more than 50 years. The film was studied frame-by-frame, used as a critical piece of evidence for those challenging the official line that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. As the conspiracy theories began to take hold, the CIA issued a memo expressing concern,
saying, “innuendo of such seriousness affects […] the whole reputation of the American government.” A memo lays out the strategy for the CIA to marginalize and discredit critics of the Warren Commission and he explains how you should do it. Secretly, you should cultivate your contacts in the newspapers, you should make “X”, “Y”, and “Z” arguments about why conspiracy is ridiculous. But the public wasn’t buying it, and by the mid 1970’s, the lasting narrative had been set. The CBS News nationwide poll last month indicated
that in President Kennedy’s case, 68% believe that Oswald 
was involved with others in the crime. I remind you that the official version is, Oswald alone was solely responsible. Only 15% believe that. As the years have gone by, I’ve come to
understand that people ache for an explanation of the unexplainable. They ache for an explanation
that’s broader, more - darker if you will than what the facts dictate the story actually is. And throughout history, conspiracy thinking
has been part of the American fabric. You can go back a couple hundred years and then you will see, “Oh, we’re afraid of the Red Coats."" And in the 1990s they’re afraid of the black helicopters. There’s always someone coming for us. You know I love great conspiracy theories,
and these are better than a lot of them. Because they say ""Why is the flag rippling? 
There is no air."" We have been conditioned 
to believe conspiracy theories. Hollywood movies, television shows, but also the federal government. The federal government kept millions of documents secret. Whether
it’s looking at Vietnam, looking at the last Iraqi war, Watergate, and you say to yourself,
""The federal government is not telling us everything."" Our government, every year, 
declares 16 million things top secret, 16 million. I would say that’s about everything. But at the same time, exploding sources of
information have left the public confused about the line between fact and fiction. At the time of the Kennedy assassination, there were a few places in the country which overwhelmingly, people in the country trusted as honest brokers of information. There’s no authority anymore. Nobody’s going to take CBS or the New York Times word for it. You don’t have a common reality, and so people can generate their own facts. This is a breeding ground for conspiracy theories. Pizzagate is real, the question is how real
is it. What is it? Something’s going on. Something’s being covered up. 
It needs to be investigated. Toward the end of 2016, conspiracy theorists
honed in on leaked Clinton campaign emails that referred to a Washington, DC pizza joint. I got a call from a reporter with the Washington City Paper, asking if I had heard about this kind of bubbling conspiracy theory 
that was on chat rooms. The online chatter focused on words in the emails, like pizza and cheese, and claimed they were actually code for a child sex ring run by top-ranking Democrats, and headquartered
at James Alefantis’s restaurant. There was like hundreds of lines of chat about
a human trafficking scheme involving Hillary Clinton that focused around Comet Pizza. You’ve got to see their menus. Notice the symbol of the ping pong paddles and it’s clever resemblance to the FBI document’s symbol for child love. It’s a bubbling noise. But then once this bubbling noise becomes broadcast on a megaphone to millions and millions of viewers, it really becomes a dangerous situation. An alarming and bizarre incident in the nation’s capital after a man opened fire at a popular pizzeria. Court documents say Welch read online that
the Comet restaurant was harboring child sex slaves. It was completely surreal, I mean,
I’m so thankful that no one was hurt. The story of Comet Pizza can only be described as an outlandish theory. There are no facts. There is absolutely no evidence. There’s no photographic evidence. There’s no written evidence. There’s no evidence. And yet it won’t go away. I do not stand behind James
Alefantis and Comet Ping Pong. Months after the theory was debunked by authorities,
protests drew people from all over the country who believe the government is involved in
the trafficking of children. To think we could stumble upon a ring like
that in Washington, DC, is very plausible. Not even an apology by Alex Jones, the so-called “king of conspiracy,” has changed the minds of true believers. It’s very difficult to dissuade people 
from their cherished beliefs. And they’ll just pick out the pieces of evidence that seem to support it, but then forget everything else that would not support it. One reason conspiracy theories catch on, according to historians, is that something larger is at play. Americans do not trust their leaders. I think
that Americans do not trust the basic institutions that govern us, whether they’re corporations,
universities, the judiciary. And that trust has been eroding for decades.
In 1964, when the Warren Report was released, 77% of Americans said they trusted
the government to do what’s right. Today, that number has plummeted to under 12%. If you don’t believe that these authorities
have your best interest at heart, if you can’t believe that these authorities are telling
you the truth, you’re still searching for answers. And what you then turn to is these counter-authorities, these conspiracy theorists who say, “I’ve
got the answers.” And with politics becoming increasingly polarized,
peddling in conspiracy has become the new normal. We’ve moved fairly quickly, fairly deeply into a post truth, post-fact era. That is, an era where any number of people, including some of them in the highest reaches of our
own government can say “Well, facts are fungible.” The challenge for the truth is, you know,
even greater than it ever has been. A lot of people have come out and said I am correct. Yeah, but the data has to show 
that three million illegals voted. Forget that, forget all of that. This president who has become an opinion-maker
supreme to at least 40% of the American people is shaping a vision that I think is going
to take us decades to remove and if his style continues as such, we are going to have a
great deal of difficulty rooting conspiracy thinking out of the American mainstream. ",1
71,"The Illuminati’s that shadowy cabal that
controls the entire world and ensures free will is an illusion.
They’ve got a big Facebook page, Celebrities like Jay-Z are accused of being members, and there are weird YouTubers like this guy. ""They had weirdos standing up everywhere, and then Beyonce--show a document of this if you can. She does the Illuminati symbol."" But what about the real history of the Illuminati
and how it became what it is today? This is Bavaria, and in 1776
Adam Weishaupt, a law professor, founded the Illuminati. It’s real.
He wanted to spread enlightenment ideals around the world.
The goal was to infiltrate the monarchy and make them more enlightened by entering their ranks. Even though they were so high-minded, they had weird rituals. See these owls? The Illuminati really loved them. And they had invented hierarchies like Novice,
Minerval, and Illuminated. Even though they were weird, they did have
some success around the world. Anywhere from 650 to 2800 members infiltrated
Freemason chapters, may have had influential members like the
writer Goethe, and even might have influenced the Jacobins,
the political club that spurred the French revolution to its most radical heights. But they were destroyed in 1785.
This is Karl Theodor — the Duke of Bavaria — and that year he banned secret societies.
That included the Illuminati. Most historians think that it worked
and the Illuminati disappeared. But if that’s true, then why do we still
think that Drake’s Illuminati today just because he wears owl sweaters? Since the beginning, conspiracy theories have
been part of the Illuminati. This guy, Xavier von Zwack, actually did have
plans to take over the world that were found after the Illuminati was banned.
American historians and preachers thought the Illuminati planted some seeds for the
French Revolution and George Washington even wrote a letter
that claimed the Illuminati had once been a threat.
But the Illuminati lost the limelight thanks to the Freemasons.
This is George Washington as a Freemason, and a lot of founding fathers really were
Freemasons. That inspired the anti-Masonic party.
It was a legitimate movement with big names like John Quincy Adams,
and the Illuminati paranoia faded around the world. So how did the myth stay alive? There were always random books, like this
one from 1918, or book reviews that mentioned the Illuminati.
But most people think the Illuminatus book trilogy of the 1970s
deserves credit for bringing the Illuminati back. It might also be why weird secret symbols
like these pyramids and triangles are associated with the Illuminati.
It was a funny series and gave new life to the conspiracy for an ironic, connected age.
They were an evil organization bent on ruling the world, sure, but they were also kind of
funny. The Illuminati was vague enough to be refit
to any purpose, from the new world order
to religious paranoia, to pop culture curio like Angels & Demons.
It became a joke. But you might believe that's what the Illuminati
wants you to think if you noticed the 14 evil yellow triangles
of power hidden inside this video. The Illuminati only really endures because
it’s disappeared and can look like anything. There’s nothing to worry about.
Nothing at all. Illuminati, Illuminati, Illuminati. So this is my humble little crazy wall and
one of the disadvantages of a crazy wall is that things aren’t as legible as you’d
like them to be. That includes this letter by George Washington. However, the Library
of Congress does tell us what it says, and it says, “It was not my intention to doubt
that the doctrines of the Illuminati and principles of Jacobinism had not spread in the United
States.” So he thought the Illuminati didn’t make it in the United States, so you can rest
assured, but, they were a threat.",1

marginalized group and it would be nice for an open-minded liberal college to accept someone like this and to recognize what a perfect person to be a part of our campaign incur urging people to uh you know to be more open-minded and accept people no they attacked her because now they felt that she is a white man and they don't want a white man in that position because if a white man is in that position then they're supporting the patriarchy so there was three other candidates for the gig right all women of color wonderful if one of them went and then you got okay you know your problem solved you got a woman of color in that position plenty of diversity there you're good right and no they all dropped out and then they stayed it they started an anonymous Facebook campaign encouraging people not to vote at all to keep a white man from winning the position ah this is amazing this is the left eating itself that's what's happening they're eating themselves it is a feeding frenzy I stab piranhas okay and one of the things about products is well one gets a limp they just Jack that motherfucker they are the most ruthless cunts when one piranha would just speak you know sometimes you have a fish tank one fish will just start swimming weird they start swimming kind of half sideways for some reason like that fish okay and you have to look at them like what's going on with that fish that shit didn't last in that tank baby those motherfuckers are just poor did you start taking chunks out of them that's what's happening here the left is they're turning on themselves they've run out of outrage they've made so many safe places they don't want anything to be safe anymore and they want to be able to go to war over everything they're ferocious they're piranhas they are social idea piranhas and they're attacking a genderqueer genderqueer masculine of Center man for not being diverse enough for being a part of the patriarchy Bart a woman born a woman lived as a woman no you're a white man now you fucking piece of shit you're a part of the problem  haha it doesn't make sense though it makes sense because it highlights what this movement is all about it's socially retarded people that are left alone to their own devices and they're just devouring each other like zombies they're just tearing into each other like like zombies that are trapped into a fucking room it is right it is ripping each other apart you're not diverse enough you're not progressive enough fuck you you're such a pig I'm triggered it just triggering each other left and right this is this is an onion article this is a fucking onion article and it's not this is a national review this is a goddamn onion article and it's not transgender woman can't be diversity officer because she's a white man now ha ha ha ha mix urethane it's all it's makes all the sense in the world that it's not a fake article I mean that's a gene perfect representation perfect it's perfect it's amazing it's beautiful it's a rose it's a rose in a bad neighborhood pops out of the concrete and it comes out perfect it's amazing this is art it's the universe creating art with our own folly that's what it is it's culture it's called it's its people you know there's something that happens if you when you deny reality when you don't look at things objectively like this I think like priests that molest kids right some of that has to be from suppression some of it has to be probably they're abused themselves there's probably all sorts of but some of that perversion has got to come from suppression it's like the Catholic schoolgirl thing that everybody knows you know when I was in high school there was no scientists in my fucking ninth grade class but we all knew that girls went to Catholic schools were hoes and why they host their hoes because everybody tells them they can't be a ho everybody's talked to them constantly about you are going to go to hell do not touch a man's genitals don't you do anything else cause we're freaks they were the biggest freaks and we all knew it it was it was there was no books on it there was no YouTube videos that we could watch but we fucking knew it man we all knew it and I think it's a suppression issue and this is suppressing in visual identity this is suppressing free speech this is suppressing objectivity you're not allowed to have unique or intertwined thoughts you're not allowed to share opinions with the left and with the right you're not allowed to you have to have and you're constantly worried about being called out you're constantly worried about being outed and doxed and called out and shamed everyone's shaming people and attacking people it's this fucking feeding frenzy ah I love it I'm happy I'm so happy when I read a story like this I would encourage this woman to fight to the death for her position oh man she's a man now fight to the death to that position I mean literally I want you to show up for school in a fucking armor with a sword and let them know that you or you are here because you are a warrior for diversity and you're going to get it you're going to take this to the very end to the very end of time oh it's amazing this is an amazing story took one of the greatest stories the universe has ever told because it's it just and it highlights that story that we were just talking about where the the thing that was up on the other thing earlier with the the United States is like a powder keg this is like what we're talking about like entitled ridiculous people that they don't live in reality you're you're not look and you're concentrating on nonsense but why they concentrating on nonsense because they don't have to worry about feeding themselves they don't have to worry about shelter they don't have to worry about being in Ohio having no fucking power for a week and everybody has to stay alive you can't get to work everybody's like walking back and forth to each other's house sharing food and going out and getting firewood together and dragging it back at some little kids wagon that's what people do when they want to survive when when you want to survive you come up with ways that you could all work together when it's too easy to survive you start attacking people for nonsense and that's the fuck is going on here you got a campaign to keep through we're going to make sure that a white man's not going to win this like if she's really a white man why are we pretending that's a man left of queer genderqueer masculine of said to shut up lock up your girl your girl or a guy whatever you are who cares what the fuck it's probably way more to this story she's just a big fish you know like she's just got getting probably just eaten too much pussy on campus they're all mad yeah it should feel good at it she's too good at it but she's genderqueer so that means I don't think you do anything I don't know what that means I think they know what it means but you know ever pansexual there was a woman who was like she was making history this is hilarious this is a hilarious story she's making history because she was the first Gentile she was the first pansexual person to take office what the fuck are you talking about what does that mean she me and she doesn't sexually identify particularly sexually attracted to either race or either gender it's either one or both Miley Cyrus is pansexual course she is that's called being a freak pansexual what exactly does that mean but go find the politician first politician as pansexual it's just so stupid Penn sexual politician it's like a new word for bisexual it's not even bisexual it's because like they have to be special and it has to be Mary Gonzales Texas State Representative identifies as pansexual in new interview first of all good for her eat that pussy suck that dick have a party honey I'm not hating do whatever you want but do we really have to make a new name for it fucking christ and I posted something about this a while back on Twitter and there was people that were defending the term pansexual I'm like fuck you fuck you for trying to muddy up the world fuck you for having this on your mind unless you're mocking it fuck you for taking this seriously fuck you for this being an actual thing where you want to debate it how bad is your job how bored you at work you're sitting in front of your Twitter account defending pansexuality you stop you stop I'm sitting she could do it I have no problems you're gonna don't get me wrong but you fucking stop if you think you're going to defend that fuck you you need to go cuts no cuts no oh he goes countries need to go cut trees and shovel snow over Jamie's parents house in the middle of the winter when the fucking powers off for a month

560,"(music) It's an important workout. I mean, in two days he's really competing on the national stage and I need to give him something with true purpose and that purpose needs to be something that builds his confidence, but lingers, right? That it stays in his subconscious until 16.5.  Videographer: Who's going to win on Thursday night? Rich Froning. Look who's here. It\'s like ""Inception."" Yesterday was probably the roughest day in my living life. If I can get through yesterday's training session, I can get through anything. 400 meters in miles is 0.25. Yeah, OK. (laughter) I've been sick for like 2 weeks now. I actually feel better, but we'll see now. 400-meter run, every 3 minutes. Ah, it was good. Now it's food time. Your head's coming way too high out of the water. It's an unnecessary amount of movement. We have to learn how to control that because that's what's really slowing you down. When I spot, it's my natural reaction to breathe thenâ€”  The neck is out of the water. So what he's doing, he's poking just his eyes out. I don't know what I'm doing. I'm not a good listener. I can onlyâ€”I have to see it. (music) Did you hear him say he never took his Speedo off until he was like 30? And he took it off, realized he didn't like it, put it right back on. Is he wearing one right now? We're making fun of you. This doesn't make it to the internet, Ian. Ian (videographer): You guys losing to a girl? It's not the girl factorâ€”she's 12. Three Games competitors lose to a 12-year-old girl. What am I doing here? (music) My nephew, Sam, has a project and he was wondering if Rich would be kind enough to let him ask him some questions. Are there any foods that you can't eat in CrossFit? Depends on who you talk to. Captain Crunch or Cinnamon Toast Crunch? Captain Crunch. What's the hardest workout you have ever done? The final in 2010. The one where I fell off the rope, I don't know if you've seen that. No, I haven't. Well, YouTube that. How does it sound when we're speaking Icelandic? I think it's cool. For me it's like, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah. It's not like we're singing? Actually you sound like two birds. Two birds, yeah. I've heard it before. I have a bird that's 17 years old. Ian: What kind of bird?  Um, I think it's called a peacock. I'm not sure what it's called. Does it have big feathers that go way out? Peacocks are like this big, Sara. No, no, no, not peacocks, parakeet. It has red cheeks. Sara's like, I have a peacock. (laughter) Yeah, in my backyard in Iceland. Yeah, I want it to be heavy. I want some weights. Heavy thrusters, it would be perfect. Thrusters, burpeesâ€”no, burpees?! Thrusters, deadlifts. I think we're going to get maybe a chipper. Not that it matters. We could talk so much about this and be like, I think ... I hope we're getting a chipper, that would be awesome. Dottirs love chippers. Hi, Pat. Pat Sherwood on Skype: So I'm interrupting your breakfast or keeping you from breakfast right now, right? Yes, you are, I'm like this close to getting hangry so watch out. Sherwood: My apologies. As a fellow food fanatic, I'll get you back to eating as quick as possible. OK, Pat you promised, if I tell you my first name, you have to say it. Sherwood: OK, I promise. It's Ragnheidur. You have to do the ""r"" in the end. Sherwood: Ragnheidur.  That was a 3, that was bad. Four bacon slices, now we're talking. Best time of the day. Mmmm. I added bacon because I'm a fatty. She's like, yeah, I'll have the same as Katrin, but with bacon. Food addict here. I admit it. Oh my gosh, this is going to be hard. I get to choose a walkout song? War Pigs with Black Sabbath. Just like witches of black masses. You don't know this song? What? Never, it's too hardcore for me. I'll go with cheerleader or something. I haven't heard that song. (music) There's only one book that matters, Austin! Tell him that book, Dan! The good old bible. Best seller, every year, for 2,000 years. (music) I really, really want to punch someone and I really want to be punched, but I don't want it to be in a fight and I don't want it to be hard feelings, I want it to be like a mutual I can punch you and you can punch me kind of thing. I can't believe this. (laughter) (music) I could never even describe the feeling of winning the CrossFit Games. It's still soâ€”people are like, so how does it feel and I'm like ... I just feel a rush of emotions. And it's like, it's the best feeling in the world. And everyday I strive to find that feeling again. Sometimes when I'm stressed I start breaking myself down. Like, oh my gosh, you can't do this. These girls are all so good and you're just Sara. Now when I'm training, I'm just thinking, are you going to let this happen again? Are you going to be secure that you can do everything? Or are you going to be the girl that always loses when she's under pressure or something? Let's do the grenade, OK? (speaking Icelandic) Nice. (laughter) They've clearly never seen a grenade before. (laughter) Why are we so ugly like this?  No, we're beautiful. We're beautiful inside. (laughter) I'll probably not do too much. I'm still sore from doing the last workout on Monday. Working out's always more fun. When you're not alone. (music) I always said before that, like, CrossFit would never be my Number 1 priority, that school will always be priority, then I'll have a job and CrossFit will be on the side. It was during the 2014 season I worked a desk job and it was pretty quickly after that that I was like, eh, I'm going to push all my chips into this CrossFit thing. It's a true teller because 275 lb. is a heavy power clean for me. (music) Double tap on that second one. Thanks for doing that with me.  Yeah. Now we're going to go shoot guns and ride motorcycles. This is my walk in sing, definitely. Definitely. What's yours, Mat? I was cracking up, I just thought, ""Hood Mentality"" by Ice Cube. There you go, that's good. Fits you. Fuck school, I'm gonna be a dope dealer. (laughter) Yeah, yeah. I'll probably just play whatever Mat does right before he does it. Ben Smith. I'm in the backgroundâ€”ahhhhh. Bro?! Aw, look at Fraser, what a douche. Using the same song as Ben, what a tool. I used to listen to a lot of rap, but now it's like I can't even understand what they're saying. And I can't really relate to what they're saying either so I'm like, eh, I'm good. Even if you look at the lyrics, I'm like this sentence doesn't make sense. That's a fragment, that's a run-on sentence. ... hard being Snoop D-O- double G but I somehow, some way ... (singing) (music) Ian: Dude, that thing is freakin' in there. Good dudes, fast motorcycles, what's not to like? Don't eat that. You don't need that.  No?  Nope. Mini Perfect Bars. We don't have them in Iceland, come on. Food for one day. I think you two have eaten more food than any of the other athletes. They make no room for time to eat here. We need our food, come on. Girl's gotta eat. So I was going to be really clever and use the coffee machine to make oatmeal this morning, and I'm very clumsy with everything, so I'll talk you through this. First step,  so I'm getting the water here. Then I went to the bathroom, came back, annnnnd it fell on the floor. And all the floor was in oatmeal and cinnamon. Second attempt, it worked and I was like, OK, how should I eat this? So I didn't have a spoon so I drank the oats. And then to make it up to the maids, I left a little tip, I'm sorry. Poor maids. Let's make it an AMRAP, team. What, Rich goes team and now everyone has to do team workouts? I don't care, I'm just working out. James you slept in until like 9 o'clock. Austin, once again, I am on vacation. I'm allowed to sleep until whenever I want. James is sensitive. I can't wait for this video to make it somewhere so all the bodybuilders can make fun of us and how bad we are at bench. (music) Ian: Made it through security.  Yeah. Smile and wave. Announcer: Two of Iceleand's strongest Dottirs here. You're going to pause, give everybody a little wave ... Once Dave makes his announcement and it's done, you'll have 10 minutes before we start the workout. Why do we have lifting platforms? There's room for handstand walk over here. Just saying. Maybe it's DT. I am so excited about being in the Open announcement. They're going to throw something at us and we're going to have to deal with it. Yeah, it's going to be pretty stressful but it's going to be a lot of fun. Contrary to popular belief, we do not know the workout until everybody else finds out I found out what the workout is when you find out what the workout is. I'm kind of plan for the worst, hope for the best. I have some bad workout in my head so that when he announces it, hopefully it's not that bad. But, I don't know, it's probably going to be terrible. Ladies and gentlemen, live from Schriever Air Force Base ... Live from Aromas, California, where it all began. And this is the announcement of 16.4. Castro: 16.5 is ... 14.5. 16.4 is ... a chipper. Sean Woodland: It's go time and we've never had these three on this floor in this setting. Castro: 3, 2, 1 ... go! 16.4 is open and ready for fitness. We are underway at The Ranch in Aromas, California. The only time you're going to see these guys going head to head. Sara off the deadlifts first, Sigmundsdottir has just a slight edge on Katrin Davidsdottir. Right now Mat Fraser and Rich Froning are trading the lead and Ben Smith is just about a half rep behind. She is finishing her set of 55 wall balls and she'll miss just hitting the bottom of the target and that might leave a little bit of room for Davidsdottir to catch up. Mat Fraser now slightly ahead of Rich Froning who's keeping that steady pace. Sara Sigmundsdottir has Katrin by 13 and she will move into her 55 handstand push-ups. He can put himself into that really dark place. He right now is ahead of Rich's time from 2014. Davidsdottir will join Sigmundsdottir on the wall. She is done with her final repetition and will work her way back down the chipper. Mat Fraser is making a statement in Aromas. Can Sigmundsdottir get through the deadlifts at the buzzer?! Fraser has bragging right and a whole lot of confidence and that could be dangerous in July. Sara Sigmundsdottir will take 16.4. Ian, I broke my nail. Really proud of you. That was the best competition I've seen you do. Awesome, man. Really well done. I barely ever looked over. That's what we were looking for. That was so hard. I just wanna look. A peek here or there is not going to crush anything. It's is that going to affect your performance? Really proud of that, too. All right, we're going to go squat. I did better than I did the last time I did it. I think I just checked, I got like 9:16, so I did improve. Just kind of go and try to hang on. I knew I probably couldn't beat him but I was going to try to bait him, see if I could bait him on that first set of thrusters and just go hard and try to hang on so, uh, whatever, it happens. I mean, I'm not surprised that he beat us on that workout. Last year during the Open was the fittest I've ever been in my life. But then by the time I'm 2 weeks out of regionals and I'm like oh my god, I'm burning out. This year, I'm not as fit as I was but I'm ramping back up in the right direction. I think I'm on a good timeline. I mean, I want to win the Games again, that'd be ideal. I may win, I may not win, it's totally up in the air but I'm going to do my best to do it again. (music) Froning: I love what I'm doing right now. I kind of play it year by year. I don't really have a set goal of how long I want to do this. As long as I'm not either bringing my team down or just making an idiot of myself, I'll keep doing it. The feeling of winning the CrossFit Games is the best feeling you can imagine. That's something I strive for everyday. It would mean the world to me to win again. (music) Your head is like 80 percent of your success. So, my head is good. I can definitely win it.",0
186,"the only reason I'm going to bring some shoes is because we've got the first part of this we've got to go through some semi rough country we're going to take you up to the original 50 and $500 house first and then we'll see the spectacular one so this is all your land up in here yeah it's a quarter of a mile by a quarter of a mile so you came out here looking for a place to build you know to buy yep you want to build your own place yep and did you know you're gonna go underground um no I didn't at first this is kind of a wild bear area this land this county here is two-thirds National Forest well my house my original house is right up there about 50 yards now this this little one that your daughter's buy that house cost $15 to build when I was in grammar school I was drawing plans for homesteads the reason I went underground was I was freezing in this little shack and it wasn't worth insulating I tried to figure what could I build that would be quick easy cheap and warm above all I guess that's a mushroom I thought maybe it was their scat bear scat is black like that and we've had our share of bears up here yeah reminds the Bears of it too unfortunately this is a 500 dollar house we dug this by hand and built the whole thing in in three months here in the northwest we don't have any Sun in the wintertime you know but I could still get just enough light to write by and to read by oh yeah sure I lived in this for over 30 years your eyes will get adjusted here pretty quick you still get a lot of light oh yeah that's that's the uphill patio and now remember the the Sun is going to go down pretty soon so we're not getting as much light as we could in here this cost only $500 but how much time I mean a lot of digging or yeah we dug dug everything by hand and now the lumber that we used in the original house was all from thrown-away lumber from the mills that's how I could build a place for $50 you know this over here is kind of an invention of mine I call this the barbecue windows the barbecue windows you can stand inside in hot weather and you're cool because you're in here you can stand in here in cold weather and stay warm because you're in here and you can cook outside and the smoke goes up that's the fire area right here yeah yeah sure we you know I had a great over it and but you don't worry about burning down your house no no underground houses do not do not burn very well so that's that's a nice thing and this has always been my bed area here and there I called the use of fire windows because I used to have campfires out there at night you see that polyethylene that's where the last bear who got in came in through one night I heard a bear out there I guess I want to open that window and something was stopping it from opening the bear had been out there that closed only this section in here was in the original 50/50 dollar house I turned it into my palatial 500 dollar house you tell me a little bit more about why you went underground well because I was freezing above ground and the reason I write about it and prophesize on it is because there are great advantages of going underground it's warm in the winter it's cool in the summer you use half the building materials you by yourself with hand tools there's less taxes the guy comes around to assess your house you say what for this hole in the ground you know it's aesthetically pleasing can be built by anyone you can camouflage it so it can't be found it's defensible it takes up none of the Earth's growing surface there's just any number of advantages to going underground why haven't we done it then why haven't we done it more on a mass scale that is a wonderful question and that's that's where I come in they haven't done it because they haven't figured out how to get windows into the places in in abundance and we figured that out I've always seen basement windows all my life I was originally going to put a basement window on the uphill side and then I thought well if I'm going to put a basement window in there why not bring it down also you know start stacking windows down on it and then I thought if I'm going to stack windows like that on the uphill side why not go out a little also and plant a garden out there so that's that's how the uphill patio came about I mean for example all of these windows here on the uphill side our windows that the normal builders and architects have never conceived of they built the first thought house they in a hillside like this they build a house like this with all the windows on the south side and they have very few if any windows at all on the rest of the house around the rest of the house so it has no balance of light and you knew you need a balance of light in a house you need windows from these two sides in every room that matters that one that you're shooting now is totally underground and unfortunately it's soon to go into the ground because it's a for 35 years now I've never done anything with it and any house that you leave go for 35 years goes pretty fast I was building this for other people when I started writing heavy again so I let it go but there was an ambitious little house in a pinch it would have slipped 17 people in here and I can't guarantee a second to collapse on us  the first plans had this idea of going underground on a hillside and having a big bunch of South windows on it that is what I call the first slot house and it's a disaster that's what everybody builds when they build underground houses these days and they shouldn't be one of the advances that I made is when I build an underground house on a hill like this I cut out the upper part make what I call an uphill patio and that gives us lots of light from the upper side in the course if you plant that it's beautiful it's wonderful but what I want to show you as a shelter house that we we don't have completed but if times get really rough I'm sure I'll have plenty of volunteers up here to complete it yeah it's the shelter s nuclear attack forest fire earth changes riots whatever what have you since its underground if we if we don't have a stove in here but we've got a lot of people in here the body temperature will will keep this livable  yeah it is it this roof ilysm at the level of the ground good idea that this is something can be replicable anywhere in the country sure and if you build it yourself it can be very inexpensive these guys he can pull off the land your posts and beams and girders and so the lumber might be maybe $300 we dug all this by hand by the way this and the other house in there so we can you juggle by hand shovels yeah I don't know how long it took us to dig wait I don't like digging much more than three hours a day but I do like digging up to three hours a day marvelous exercise you can see your progress you know as you're going good with mattock work it digging is fun within reason well we can start moving down we got a lot more to see Hey for two years before I moved up here I was a labor labor foreman wherever the machines couldn't dig we I saw that houses could actually be built you know how do you rotate with your bills how do you find a good spot by instinct by sleeping out on the site for a while when I was building for other people I would go up and I would sleep out on the site for a couple of nights get the feel of the place so you don't look for a certain type of dirt or a solidity to the dirt or something for building I would and in fact we're in about the prime building underground building area I've ever found  it's silt and sand and a bit of clay the walls stand up when you when you dig either by hand or with a machine they stand up and hold their shape and there's no rock here which is really nice when you're hand digging you just love to be a bare foot now all my life really yep so for you back to the land is quite literal yeah yeah yeah  would you consider yourself part of the back to land movement oh absolutely I was in the first wave of the hippie back-to-the-landers in 68 probably 10,000 hippies left the San Francisco area in the month of May I was one of that 10,000 we were biting off more than we could chew but what we could chew was wonderful  this looks like a traditional house this is from this side ah you want from the other sides what an underground house is not an underground house is nowhere in common with the basement then a penthouse apartment has in common with a hot dark dusty attic you walk into this house from ground level and you take a few steps in and you're suddenly 12 feet underground beneath the surface rather we're 12 feet beneath the surface here we're 6 feet beneath the surface over there we would be somewhere between 12 and 6 feet beneath the surface on the south side and on the north side but we've excavated for four windows and for air and light and so forth you know at this point the earth was a little more than six feet deep here six feet deep at the end of that so is probably 8 or 10 feet deep here yes it doesn't feel underground no it's not technically underground it's a this is an earth integrated house we're working with the earth you know take it out if you want windows and doors this is one of our least completed rooms this is a bunk room and the upper bunks got good window the lower bunk we're going to get a two-foot-wide culvert and we're going to dig out a trench in the solid earth here and then back fell over it so the kid lying in bed there can still see Canada even though he's a solid earth between him and Canada this would be the bathroom we got some of the plumbing in but we don't have any water supply up here yet so we're not in any hurry to finish the bathroom this is called the cooks room it's the best bedroom in the house they get the best bed best mattress so you're insulating oh yeah we're above ground at this at this point but we're not insulating on these walls because it's Ella ders behind there this could be done in any limit sure matter each the temperatures of the climate up to any extreme degrees so if you live in a really hot climate or a really cool climate its work even better in really Hut and really cold climates and eight foot down the earth stays at the yearly mean temperature where that climate here it stays about 52 degrees an earth integrated house we're working with the earth we're not overwhelmed by the earth we don't overwhelm the earth we're working with her with the mother the heat from your house in the wintertime it's not escaping out into the atmosphere it's heating the outside of your house they and it still keeps eating in the outside of your house it retains that heat and the same thing on the cooling it's cooling your house in the summertime we're on a ridge at this point the ridge is fairly levels we cut through the ridge so we got lots of light from the south and lots of views from the north and good light from the north too  normally I wouldn't I wouldn't use this this is a little atrium type thing here but I needed windows in there and needed windows here and I needed windows there so I built a little atrium one of the designs underground designs that I've developed here is you see how this part of the roof slants back before it comes down like this normally the roof is slanting like this but up here it's got an additional slant like this so that raises it above the normal pitch of the roof and that allows us to put windows in there and then all along that side and I call that a Sun scoop and as far as I know it's the first one ever built we want a house that's got windows on all four sides even though it's earth integrated and my all my other houses even if they're totally underground they still have windows on all four sides not everywhere in all four sides but they have windows on all four sides so we have light coming into a room from two directions in every room and that's really really really important it's funny because inside it doesn't feel like it's underground but outside it actually looks underground 50 percent underground yeah it looks like it just has to so is it just because you've chosen the opening so carefully well yeah sure sure there's there's one room here that's totally underground that's on the other on the other side of those other side of those windows we call that the cool room it's kind of like a mini root cellar we got three-foot earth on that roof that would do us in case of atomic attack  that's the cool room yep yeah it's like it's like a root cellar in inside the house we've actually got a deep freeze that can go in there it runs off at 12 volts  so really feels by conventional this feels a conventional living room to an extent it doesn't feel you know underground is it feel no but at the buoy are underground you know this is all earth on the roof fact we are super Earth integrated the walls are filled with earth in this house and that does a number of things it cuts the radiation if we're come to that to make the place fire resistant it helps insulate between the rooms it's dirt cheap so you're also probably saving on some insulation and oh sure oh sure my type of construction it does give support you have a beam here and a beam here and if you got earth behind it and you put a girder or something across there then the pressure from this side is counterbalanced by the pressure from that side you know so it becomes a very stable structure so you feel that anybody could do this it just is it like post-and-beam or is it a different idea no it's called PSP post sure and polyethylene system a post second to the ground we've treated or protecting it the wood from the earth nowadays I'm protecting them by charring them first of all which will double the lifespan of a post on the ground that's a post shoring as lumber out here you're going to have to have at least 2 inch lumber and most hillsides and your post should probably be not more than 6 feet apart and then you put a layer of polyethylene wrap the the lumber with a layer of polyethylene and you've got an extremely low-cost house extremely fire resistant radiation resistant wind resistant and it's going to heat you in the winter time and it's going to cool you in the summertime ok this is my own apartment here that's the kitchen area that's the dining table there and this is my work table where I'll be doing when we're writing ok though we're on the on the second floor at this level here we're approximately lower close to 3 foot below surface at this level here in this part of the house over here we're totally below the surface although it's a that's only it's only another 3 feet or so itself there something like this might be working visiting 2 people because it does look more conventional that they should integrate with the earth yeah I'm hoping so this is only 1,800 square feet we're bringing it in for probably one-tenth the cost of construction down in California or someplace like that you know all these structural members were off the land so it didn't cost me anything other than building it of the structural members in the cross supports here maybe they were off land the these two windows were salvaged and so they were only a couple of bucks each the challenges to come up with a integrated plan where you can put used used windows into a into a room and have a pattern that's pleasing to the eye I buy a lot of used windows and I number each window and I measure each window and I'll cut out little scale window models and I'll sit down and I'll you know you know I'll play with these things for a couple of nights and I come up with you know I like I like that I like those guys over there in particular my favorite this was this was kind of a tough one to come up with but I like it too the only window that I had to pay any real money for was that little gap there that angle guy I probably got these two big windows here for probably the two of them for 10 bucks I thought I was going to be able to pull this in for $15,000 as it turns out it's going to be probably 40,000 because can't do the labor myself anymore you based your ideas at all in untraditional designs I know there's a lot of traditional cultures that have gone underground Native Americans six example yeah Native Americans went underground from the Dakotas they had great big underground places with Don Wilson went whole to eliminate the smoke and let in light down to the southwest where they went three foot underground and then then arch natural vegetation over it  you'll find various cultures who have gone underground I am totally absolutely irrevocably convinced that we are living in Industrial Age we are the ones who are living in poverty not the indigenous people of this world this was a $50 an up underground house book and it's been pretty much supporting me since 78 when I brought it out this is the house we were in earlier today that's that's the five hundred dollar house here's the first thought design you get Windows from only one side generally in a house like this which is terrible light you get all your drainage going back into the hillside and all your drainage coming down into the hillside and it's going to back up against this back wall I don't care what you do sooner or later that back wall is going to leak you have no cross ventilation in there you have no egress out the back it's a terrible thought house instead we turn it around like this we put in uphill patio there and all the moisture is coming down the hill absorbs into the ground before it reaches the house and if it is on a north slope you get a tremendous amount of light in there if it's on a south slope then you're going to put in Gables going to put in Royer fires you're going to put in Hollywood wings you're going to put in Sun scoops so there's no reason whatsoever to build an underground house that doesn't have all the windows you could possibly want in there this is the house we built for a client everything it was that was exposed to the atmosphere was windows or doors this was a 5,000 square-foot underground house with a greenhouse built in the early 1980s for $20,000 here was an underground house built in Holland the authorities came out and said hunts we understand you have been building illegally here and Hunt said take a look around man you know it's um I'm busy you'll have to look around yourself and they walked around this house and didn't see it the advantages of building an underground house especially with our method there's less tax to pay on it it's warm in the winter it's cool in the summer  it's a fallout shelter it cuts atmospheric radiation it's defensible its concealable it's relatively fireproof no foundation is needed less other building material your pipes should never freeze they're weatherproof I can't believe people build houses in tornado and hurricane country if they went underground they're prettier down weather proof less maintenance on the places can be built by just about anyone they're pretty soundproof and because you're not taking up any or growing service you have increased yard space most aesthetically pleasing because you're working with nature so well and the reason people haven't gone underground because they haven't figured out yet how to get windows in the place and that's what we've done here in Idaho we figured that out for them  you",0
83,hello everybody welcome back to the shop thanks for choosing to spend a little time with me in the shop today if you haven't already done so please go down below and click Subscribe also don't forget to click the bell right next to the word subscribe that way I can send you a message every time I put up a new video now today's video is going to be on filters what I've decided to do is to cut open a bunch of filters and show you what's inside  one of those things as a mechanic that just drives me crazy is the marketing wank that comes around any automotive product our product is better it makes your car last longer your engine go for a million miles where's the proof the proof is in the puddin this is going to be our puddin for today  [Music]  [Music] so one of the things I wanted to do before we actually cut these filters open is I wanted to show you some of the parts of the filter and explain actually how the filter works so first off the filter screws on and there is a gasket if you do this yourself you know this gasket needs to be lubricated before you put it on otherwise you have a pretty tough time getting it back off secondly there's some threads in here these threads are specific to the vehicle now how does this actually work well this can holds the oil pressure for the vehicle so oil goes through the filter in a pretty specific direction oil goes through all of the holes on the outside as it goes through all the holes on the outside it pushes past this little rubber valve right here this valves called an anti drain back valve so when the oil is pushing in it pushes this out of the way okay comes into the filter itself flows around the outside of the filter in its force through the filter media into the center channel where it comes back out through the center of the filter  [Music]  so first of all they can the wick scan is by far the heaviest gauge can it actually has a legitimate spring that holds the filter in there the filter is a very high quality so it feels like a very heavy material folks this is where it gets pretty unbelievable for me remember the one that was - the pretty orange color that looked like it was such a great filter let me show you what you get inside the baseplate is a fairly high quality the gaskets standard the anti drain back valve look at that can you see the cardboard that's stuck on that that's unbelievable to me but look here look at the quality this filter is already rusted on the inside these are brand new filters I just ordered these a week ago you can see that it's already rusting on the inside of the filter now where's that rust gonna go it's gonna go inside your engine before I cut this apart I just got to tell you this has got to be beyond about the most cheeseball thing I've seen so far look at the filter coming apart already absolute garbage by far by far the napa gold filter is the highest quality which not surprisingly is second only to the wicks filter when you look at the filters as a whole the napa gold filter and the wicks filter far surpasses anybody else the Purolator filter is what I would call standard quality the can is nothing remarkable the filter on the inside is actually pretty good it's fairly well made it doesn't break apart easy the spring is a typical bent metal type spring the base plate is a heavy base and the anti drain back vowels is a is an acceptable quality next is the Fram this folks is why I made this video see this Fram filter can you see that Fram filter you see that Fram filter this filter is cardboard there's no metal in it and notice when I took it apart the cardboard is already coming apart in it it's already rusted inside the filter inside there is the drain back valve doesn't even do anything but push inside the cardboard the base is of good quality I'll give them that standard type spring but holy cow the filter is already starting to separate from the cardboard just by a little twisting action so can you imagine what happens to it when oil pressure starts pushing through it garbage the Bosch filter the filter itself is what I would call an acceptable quality it's rugged its rigid typical crapola spring the basis of high quality it's a very thick heavy material and the anti drain back valve is of a good quality too  let's cut them apart see what we got [Music]  real quick synopsis let's do a side-by-side comparison on the filters and and how they all line up the Napa gold filter is a very high quality you can see it has a joiner reinforcing bar here that joins the pleats reinforces everything you notice that it's very solid the inner workings of the filter itself it's put in here with some kind of elastomeric compound to to glue the filter in place next one up is the Purolator pretty good quality it's not as rigid as the Napa gold filter is but it's what I would call an acceptable quality not too keen on the springing thing that's in here baseplate on this particular filter is very heavy-duty drain back valve as a Parker part number on it partner is a maker of a lot of seals and hydraulic hoses and rubber next up is the Fram filter what can I say I mean when you pull a filter open just like the filter for the small-block Chevrolet we pulled apart was rusted inside this one's rusted inside as well folks that's complete garbage that's unacceptable to even to even think about buying something that has that low of quality control when I even tried to cut the filter apart look what happened the cardboard is just it's I can't I just I'm almost speechless next up is the wicks filter which was absolutely identical to the Napa gold we kind of already theorized that again high-quality same setup here you can see I wrenched on this one a little bit kind of pulled it apart but very high quality it's got a joiner borrower it joins the two pleats together so there's no leakage where the pleats meet up it's a good sturdy piece of material both of these have the proper spring and I'm a real spring the base plate is very heavy and it's got to be 10 gauge material that this is made out of both anti drain back valves are very heavy-duty then we'll move to the Bosch filter so the Bosch filter I can say pretty much with 100% conviction is the same filter as the pure later with a different brand name on it again same as pure later it's a good quality filter not nearly as heavy duty as the wicks or the napa gold they by far are the most high quality but let's just not look at quality look at let's look at the fill our media itself but you can't compare this filter media that's this long to this filter media here where my fingers are is where the filter media for the pure later ends and this there's that much more filter media where the filter media for the wicks napa gold filter goes that more filter media means the more surface area that can trap particulates in your engine so without a doubt I can tell you that I will never buy one of these filters ever if I was on a deserted island and the only auto parts store that was open had one of these filters there might be the only time I would consider using this filter because otherwise not a filter for my choice never will be one in my shop especially not when two filters in a row both have rust inside the filter and not just a little surface rust actually flaking rust that you can actually wipe off onto your fingers when you can see that in your fingers like that that's going into your oil into your engine I hope this has brought a little insight to what is actually inside these filters and the marketing wank behind what they try to get you to think as a high quality filter thanks for spending some time with me here in the shop don't forget to subscribe to the do write

262,"[Music]  hi I'm Chuck with iws motor coaches it's been a while since I've done one of these videos me and my family have been out travelling around and our renegade having a little bit of fun so the last couple videos have had just music because well I wasn't here so today we're gonna talk about this 2020 renegade XL that we have and the renegade XL is really one of our flagship models it's one of renegades flagship models and I'm going to talk a little bit more about that but before we get too far because of all the comments out there that are coming about my legs I want to get some things clear number one I didn't ride a chicken in here and number two those aren't strings hanging out there for my actual legs so easy on the comments when it comes to my suntan line anyways enough with that having a little bit of fun more about this 2020 renegade XL what really I want to talk a little bit about the differences in construction so the renegade XL as you can see has an aero cap and it's only available with an aero cap that nice slope on the front you also notice up here at the top of the motorhome that it has a real nice radiused edge and in the back has a radius and a fiberglass end cap this is different construction than a renegade classic and this is this coach is made from laminated sidewalls and the best way I can tell you is imagine if the wall wasn't here you would see some aluminum tubing almost like studs in a in a framed house but they're aluminum tubing and then what they do is they basically lay that down on a big table and then the insulation goes in it and then another fiberglass sheet lays over it and they vacuum them together and that becomes a laminated sidewall they've they've laminated the pieces of fiberglass to it it makes a really nice smooth one-piece side you don't see any rivets there's no screws it's just a beautiful lÃ©a justjust a beautiful side here the other neat thing about the this co-chair being a flagship model is renegade this has a four color paint job on it and it's double clear-coated so the first clear coat goes on then it's sanded and then there's another clear coat and it's just a breathtaking look here a few more features about this motorhome that and we'll go into it a lot more in depth as we walk around it but it's tandem axle so it has a 80,000 pound gross combined weight rating so that means you can put this motorhome on a scale with the trailer and it could weigh up to 80,000 pounds so you have way more chassis underneath this motorhome it's just complete overbuilt and that's something that our customers like and we like and that's what really drove us into this market coming from the towing industry is as we felt other motorhomes out there didn't have a big enough chassis under and to support the things we want to do the other neat thing about hand up having tandem drive and both of these axles do drive this one isn't a tag is that you get an extra set of brakes underneath the back when would you go from single rear axle to attend an axle that's easy anytime you go over 37 foot we're gonna move you into a tandem this coach is 45 foot length and one thing I do want to point out you know when I started out in this any of you that have been with me on my journey as we've been building our business I started out with a 30 foot motorhome to pull my jet boat wanted something very maneuverable and as I've learned more and grown over the years me and my family now we're up to a 42-foot Motorhome because it gives us the things that we want and I just I don't have any trouble getting around these things drives so nice the they're they're extremely stable and about the only way to get that across is to have you come out here and I'm one of them with us and I think you'll see that just driving this 45 footer is just it's a dream it's very easy to do I know we had a gentleman in Mike out of Texas the other day and he talked a lot about these videos and said he was out here because of that it meant a lot to me Mike if you're watching I wanted to apologize that it wasn't able to get over and spend more time with you I had something come up but thanks for coming out so he asked me to really add a lot more detail to these videos and that's what I'm gonna do so we're gonna start here actually since we've got the Sun let's back up a little bit and talk about the back of this motorhome I'm gonna go ahead and step over here but as you can see it has a real nice fiberglass wrap around the back it offers better aerodynamics than a classic it's a little more slippery as it goes through the air as a result you're gonna get better fuel economy with an XL still has the 40,000 pound trailer hitch here on the back this has the two and five sixteenths ball we're awful also offering this coach with a receiver hitch too if you were to pull a trailer with air hookups we can hook your gladhands on here if you want you'll notice two exhausts coming out of the back of the motorhome this exhaust is off of the aqua hot diesel fired heater that heats the water and and heats the inside of the coach we'll talk more inside this exhaust right here is off of the 12.5 kW generator this here is just a backup light when you put it into reverse you can see they got these real nice LED stop turn and tail lights this plug-in right here is for your trailer connection and this is for your voyager camera so if you look up here you'll see we have a backup camera and then there's a third brake light vot lights in our area light but that back up camera will illuminate or show you what's going on back here but with the voyager if you're pulling a long trail we can put another camera on the back of your trailer and then you would just plug that in right here while we're back here excuse me I got allergies today so I may be sneezing through this you can see our back up light or our area light that we put here on the back so when you're hooking up a trailer at night or maybe you're just out at the lake and you need some lights you can flip that light on that's one of the options that we do and it's pretty standard on any iws coach that we build we think it's the right thing to do you'll also see there's two more going down the roof there so in this first compartment I'm going to open it up this is just a large storage compartment you can see we have the receiver hitch in there these are insulated doors they're carpeted inside you'll notice this wire right here so that tells you that we have a remote-controlled door lock feature on this compartment door we're gonna go ahead and move forward this is where we have the 450 aqua hot heater and what this is is this is a diesel fired burner inside and it runs hot glycol so what happens is in the winter the diesel burner will come on it uses the diesel fuel in your fuel tank as you're driving down the road or when you're parked and that diesel fires that burner up and then this hot glycol is recirculated through the coach and that's what heats the coach neat thing about that is if you're traveling down the road in the winter you can flip a switch and the engine heat will cycle through here so you're not running the diesel burner when you're heating the Motorhome when you do get to your RV hookup you can plug it in and it'll go from diesel fire to electric fired the only thing I do want to point out is if you want a really super hot shower you'll leave it plugged in and the electrical take the water up to a certain temperature and then the deesser burner will kick on when you need that extra boost of super hot water alright that's enough of the aqua hot now as here's our  area lighting right here this will come on you can flip a switch on there and that's going to go ahead and eliminate this area when you're backing up it operates independent than our upper lights here as we get here here's another large storage compartment  we also offer shelves and stuff that's something we build here at iws for our customers here's another compartment that we have right here large storage compartment here's a built-in television so if you notice we have the Sun coming down on us here you can still see that when the Sun Goes Down and it gets later in the night you can push this up to its second stage 32 inch flat-screen TV in here DVD player you can play music through the speakers this is just a really nice addition for this RV go ahead and close this up here you have a 2 110 outlet so if you want to run a barbecue grill or power up you know an Xbox or something out here you can do that there's another storage compartment so pretty much all the compartments on this side which is known as the curb side of the motorhome or the passenger side these are virtually all storage compartments except for the last one now as we come up here to the entrance door it's a real nice curved radius door this grab handle illuminates at night and then there's a key code here so you can use this to get in and out of the coach I'm going to open the door just a little bit ready gates done a nice job of upgrading the door handles so you got a nice grab handle to grab on when you open this the wind won't pull it out of your hand it's got a really nice screen right here and then you can slide this to lock it if you don't want to use that you can hook it on right here I'm going to go ahead and flip the step lock so when I close the door it's not going in and out we move back up here to the cab the chassis cap you'll see this Bendix Bendix sensor and what that does is there's a there I'll show you when we get inside the cab there's a light on the passenger side on the a pillar of the of the truck and this sensor is always looking out here and if anybody or anything gets in in this sensor area a sounds gonna go off inside and a little lights going to illuminate to let you know there may be somebody here in your blind spot now as we move around up onto the hood of the vehicle here's your turn signal camera so this camera is looking back at this angle when you turn your right turn signal on this is going to give you a view down this side of the coach so this is kind of the blind spot of any Motorhome when you're a driver what's really neat is you've got a camera looking back you got this really big mirror looking back and you have this electronic sensor looking back so you've got an awful lot of coverage here in the blind spot spot and it makes driving these things a lot easier while I go ahead and move around I'm going to go ahead and let Zack kind of film around the front you can get a good look at these LED headlights that's new for on these 20/20 models I think they just look really sexy in there it's a good looking coach you'll also notice on the front you have these holes and this is where you can put in the pole rings this is the front-facing sensor that's going to tell you if you're getting too close to a vehicle there's an alarm inside that'll go off we'll talk about that collision mitigation when we get inside there's also a sensor up in the top of the windshield that's looking forward as well and it's helping to make sure you're staying inside the lane so if you drift out of your lane audible alarm is going to sound I'm going to go ahead and open up the hood here and talk a little bit about this Detroit engine  go ahead and open the hood what's really neat about a Class C motorhome is serviceability just about anything you want to access is right here so it's really easy when you if you break down you could take it into a Freightliner dealer you don't have to take it to anybody super specialized you can take it to a Detroit distributor most truck shops whether it's Freightliner Kenworth Peterbilt can all service a Detroit engine serviceability is another thing here's your windshield washer fill it's really easy to get to here's your transport hooks if you need to use them for anything excuse me I want to talk to you a little bit more about this engine so this is a Detroit DD 16 engine 15 point 8 liters it's 600 horsepower currently it's the largest engine produced that we can have put into a class 8 truck we can't buy anything any bigger so we're for our customers we're putting the biggest and the baddest engine in these things we possibly can what's really neat about this engine is it would not it so in the if you were to look in the used truck paper you'll see a lot of trucks for sale with three hundred four hundred thousand miles that's low miles in the truck world high miles in the truck world or seven eight hundred to a million miles plus that's a lot better that's getting high mileage that's not even excessive miles it's reasonable to believe based on the be 50 life rating of this engine that you should expect to get close to a million miles if not more out of this engine without any service what major service works so this thing's designed to be ran I haven't looked lately but I believe the oil change interval on this engine is twenty-five thousand miles on normal duty so it's kind of like well I forget the guy's name on king of the hill they asked him how often he changes his oil and he said every 3,000 miles or when I get bored and I can assure you you're probably gonna get you'll you'll either get bored or you'll have too many years going before you hit the mileage that you need to change the oil on these and that and that all goes back to cost what I'm trying to say to you is this is a truck engine and it's gonna last this thing a lifetime this truck will be running up and down the road long after I've gone it's just an incredible power plant okay I'm gonna go ahead and close the hood up and then we're gonna go ahead and pause while I turn this thing around so we can get the sun shining on this side and we'll talk a little bit more about the features you know actually what I want to do is I'm going to go ahead and run the awnings out and run the slides out on this side [Music] okay we're going to go ahead and run the hunting out Zach I'm gonna have you back up just a little bit because I really want people to see this two-stage effect to it so the awning comes out straight and then it's going to droop down to really help when you have a low Sun we actually have a fairly low Sun today so you're going to see hopefully you'll start to see some shades start to develop  so just to give you an idea for height so I'm 6 foot tall so you're you're looking at about an 8 foot eave height right here there's also an LED light strip that runs the full length of this it does a really nice job in the evening of just casting some light down here on you there you can see the slide outs out one of the reasons we're not a big fan of putting a slide right here is because it really takes away from this experience of being able to sit back here and here and have a nice chair and just look at it like right now I'm looking out at the beautiful Idaho mountains Bennett Mountain right over there and if I have a slide right here it starts to take away from all of that space ok now I'm going to go ahead and run the awning back in and pull the slide in and we're going to turn this beauty around [Music] okay here we are so we got her turned around so I'm going to walk you through the compartments on this side so this first apartment is where the batteries are housed there's also an air connection here if you want to hook an air hose on to air up your tires there's an airport given right there to large 8 D batteries these are for the Motorhome and these are for the chassis this compartment houses the inverter and there's also room in here for storage so the neat thing about the inverter what it's going to do is take the 12-volt battery power it converts it to AC electricity so like right now the coach is not plugged in the generator is not running but you could still be sitting inside enjoying TV refrigerator still going to run we come along this side this is sewage compartment there's a sewage tank in here and it continues on into this compartment so what you have is you have 75 gallons of greywater storage which is shower and sink water and then you have 75 gallons of black tank storage which is what comes out of the toilet some notable features that we do here is that we add extra heat strips to the bottom of these so they won't freeze we also have an aqua hot heat exchanger in there so that in the winter it's circulating circulating hot like all through the compartment to help keep these from freezing we also have a ceramic insulation insulation package sprayed inside of here so you know it's hard for people you know what what separates one dealer from the other and we just try to do it right we try not to cut a single corner look the last thing I want is for you to call me two years from now or a year from now after buying this and say geez Chuck I wish you'd have told me about ceramic temp coat and I wish you would have told me about aqua hot heating options in here we don't want you to have any regrets so we try to do everything in our power to load this thing up with every option that we fill this coach that had or that our customers still have added a lot of value to their coaches one of those options is the macerator so what the macerator is it's this pump right here and it has an impeller in it and what it does is it grinds up all the waste product in it and it emulsifies it so that when you go to drain your black tank and your gray tank this is the only hose you have and you just take this hose stick it in the ground turn it on and then you can hit the switch and it'll pump now in the event that this should ever fail you can disconnect right here and put the regular 3-inch black hose on so we've tried to build some redundancy okay this back compartment right here is our wanted water management compartment for a lot of you watching this video you know all about this but for those of you that don't I'm gonna walk you through a few things here's your low point drain so what this will do or excuse me this is your pressure I spigot so this is just like a water spigot at your house you can hook a hose on wash your car off wash the motor home with this is a low point drain so in the winter when you if you want to winterize you open this valve up and all the water will drain backwards out of it so the water from here to the motor home won't freeze this is called a spray away there's a coiled hose right inside of here with a spray one on it you pull it out hook it on here and you'll have more of a high-pressure hose which is great for hosing out coolers or spraying off kids they got too much sand on their feet it's a nice option this flojet turns on the macerator pump you pull this out to dump your black tank your gray tank this is your black tank wash so when you hook your water hose on right here onto that fitting there's a sprinkler inside the black tank that'll run and it washes out your black tank cable TV TV input and your freshwater input you can choose from city water or to fill your tanks so this motorhome has a hundred and fifty gallons of freshwater storage underneath the master bed which is really nice or any gates move that water inside so that it doesn't freeze in the winter one hundred and fifty gallons so let me tell you what so we were just up in salmon Idaho me and two other people we were up there for a Razer rally dry camping we were three of us were able to shower every single night cook do most of our normal stuff and we were able to go four days and four nights without running out of water and and that was without skimping so 150 gallons is a lot of water now as we move around to the back this is the last two compartments here's our own in 12.5 kW generator and this is a monster if you look right I'm going to move around here and get in here if you look right here you'll see that that's a Kubota engine so that's the same engine that they would use in a Kubota tractor this is just an incredible power plant it's I feel it's the right choice it's more power than you need but again we don't want you to have any regrets this is exact same generator I have in my personal coach if you read the manual on this Kubota will tell your Cummins Onan will tell you they'd rather you run this generator a lot than to run it just a little bit use this thing run the heck out of it and and just enjoy life  now that we come into the last compartment this is our powered cord reel so you manually pull it out I got to scoot around you here and then when you want to wind it in you just push the button and it winds in your 50m we also have a surge guard inside of this coach we've had renegade put in a 30 amp outlet as well as just a regular 20 amp outlet so you can run power tools this one our theory is if you want to buy a stacker trailer from us we sell ATC all aluminum stacker trailers you want to put a big stacker trailer behind this we can run that cord plug it in and you'll have enough generator run the to be able to run the air conditioning in your stacker trailer with all of that being said it's time to move to the inside of the coach wow that's the first thing that everybody says when they come into this coach it's just absolutely breathtaking in here  we wanted to take a moment and pan around to try to let you take this coach in and look at the colors the ultra leather fabrics the countertops the lighted edges in the countertops the solid maple cabinetry the vessel Bowl sinks in the bathroom the Flex steel furniture the picture windows that we put in this coach it's just breathtaking  [Music] I'm gonna have Zack show you the overhead decor in this coach so you can see the infinity light it's just beautiful up there well now now that we've done a quick pan around in the coach and let you kind of absorb it I'm gonna go a little bit slower talk about some of the features here's the digital controller this is where you can control the door slides you can turn the lights on and on I'll go back to the to the coach slides can be controlled from here here's your water tanks and sewage this is where you can start the generator  here's your lighting controls the interior and exterior it's very intuitive very easy to run this here is your awning control so we can excuse me turn the awning on you can run it out you can set the intensity level at which the wind can blow before the awning comes in just a really nice feature before we get going too far too much further on the interior a lot of people have asked us how loud is the generator how loud is the air conditioning so today here in Idaho it's going to be over a hundred degrees outside it's the heats building so we've went ahead and started the generator the air conditioners are running right now and we're gonna leave them on throughout the coach so you can really get a sense of what it's like to be in one of these with the generator and air conditioning on so here we have the television and you can pull this lever right here you can slide the TV out and pivot it you know wherever you want to have the the best viewing angle also has a built-in sound bar I really think it was a good decision to go away from the speakers in the ceiling to this because when the speakers are in the ceiling and you're watching TV up here the people in the back are getting blasted so with the sound bar it kind of controls the direction of the sound and I think this is a really good upgrade you can also play your Bluetooth music through it and all of that here we've got all of the overhead cabinetry as I mentioned before the neat thing is is that renegade finishes them out the back of the cabinet is well finished out as the front of the cabinet here you can see we've got a reclining rocker this is a great feature on it it's a great place to you can slide it out and kick back you can turn it around if you want to watch TV or just keep it here if you have guests we have a lot of people that travel with their dogs and they actually take the recliner out and put their dog crates right here so it's just a great utilization of space now as we move over here to the rest of the kitchen cabinets you can see all the really nice wood trim balances I'll go ahead and remove these seat covers or sink covers place them here on the seat you've got a very deep residential sink you know we're always torn whether to do a split sink or a single sink based on the feedback from our customers they really like the single sink so that's pretty much what we're going with we have overhead lights right here so there's lots of lighting here we put in extra outlets here in the backsplash and notice the tile when we have a coach built we request the tile go all the way up here on the countertop you'll notice the LED light edges that you can program these different colors and get them to do a whole bunch of things here's the true induction cooktop as I mentioned on a lot of videos we really like it because it gives you a lot of counter space it'll only get hot if you have kids if the plates metal so there's magnets in here that have to activate to get this to work here we have the Samsung microwave it's a convention microwave I said this in just about every video I've ever done we liked it so much we have one at our house we really like that convention or convection cooking here's a little bit you can see a nice detail of the dovetail construction of the cabinet's on this it's all solid maple hardwood soft close drawers this actually has the stacked silverware drawer in it so you can have silverware on the bottom and on the top lots of storage we've got a spot here that you can tilt the house you can keep your scrub brushes and and and stuff here for the sink there's storage under here this is a little storage space that my wife is I think she had a big hand in its making sure that there was a spot to store pots and pans so we really try to whenever we can have renegade design in a large area for that got some more storage underneath you can see the finish work is just awesome and we're gonna go ahead and open up this pantry this this a newer style of pantry it's a slide-out that we're trying it's fully adjustable so you can adjust the shelves up and down and then you can store your canned goods and whatever you want in here you can see the holes here that Aden adjusting we've also put a neat little latch on it so it can stay closed down here is the electrical panel so if you have a circuit breaker issue or anything you've got really quick and easy access to it up above here is all of the digital because this is a whole digital management system what's really neat is so number one is the living room ceiling light you can go to number one we got a green light so everything's are good so we can really aid you in diagnostics and that's something maybe now is a good time to just bring up our advantage package so one of the things that we're doing that we feel is very exclusive is we've invested heavily in to our video department typically we have three full-time videographers and what we're doing is we're making our advantage videos we're making very detailed mini videos on you know how to use this power distribution panel and what to do if you have a problem how to run the generator how to run the auto generator start what to do if your macerator doesn't work and we're developing these videos and when you buy a motor home from us we provide you with our own iPad that has all of these videos embedded in it we also give you access a private access to the back side of our website where our customers can log in and watch these videos so if you're traveling down the road there's so much to remember and you can't remember how to program your generator you can watch that little mini video each year we just add more and more to it and that's something that's only available to our customers a few more things about our exclusivity I've always felt we want to sell luxury coaches and back it up with luxury service our shop is one of the best shops in the nation we only work on our customers motorhomes that's it we want to make sure we stay exclusive to you we also have our V hookups on site we just put in two more brand new ones so when you're traveling by our facility you can swing in use our RV site for a day or two if you want and then you can move on we also wash your motorhome for free when you swing in we want you to feel like this is home a home away from home you can come in we also offer extended roadside service free of charge when you buy a motor home from us we fill up the fuel tanks we fill up the propane tanks we're gonna put you up not at our RV site we go ahead and put you up at the RV site downtown because we would like you to go down there and really just set up for one night and come back to us in the morning if you have any questions all of these things are exclusive only to our customers so we're really trying to make sure we're available to you and we back that up by offering 24-hour seven-day-a-week service so people here rotate having an emergency cell phone with them so if you have any problems you can call us and you're gonna get a voice on the other end of the line to try to walk you through whatever problems so we really take pride in trying to make this experience the best we can for you well we're gonna move over here and talk a little bit about the frigerator as you can see it's a double dent our double door Samsung Refrigerator lots of room in here it's a actual residential refrigerator renegades also put a latch right here so you can lock the door I'm gonna slide open the freezer so you can see that there's a icemaker here a tray here for more frozen food and in the larger tray down there on the bottom now as we move over here to the dinette this is a feature we've been waiting for for quite a while renegade is now offering dual seatbelts in the dinette as its facing forward so if you have kids or guests they can sit here at the dinette be buckled in while you're traveling down the road there's also three seatbelts in the sofa so you can carry up to five people guests in the back and they'll all be seat-belted in here we are at the dinette this is kind of a neat feature that we've been installing now for several years so I'm pretty proud of is we're having renegade put these nice picture windows here it's quite a bit bigger so we've eliminated the overhead cabinets to try to give you a real nice spacious view out the window I think it works very well  here's the day shade so as you pull it down it reduces the Sun glare and then you can pull down your Night Shade and have even more privacy at night you can see there's built-in drink holders here solid surface countertop it's very similar to quarry on another nice thing is you can unfold this lever and you can push this guy down and then you'll have a spot for guests to sleep raise it back up lock it in place another neat feature or these built-in drawers that slide out and have them on both sides I also want to point out that there's a 110 and a USB outlet underneath the the dinette here it's very nice to be able to charge your phone or your laptop I'm not going to spend a lot of time talking about the sofa it folds out into an air mattress I have the exact same sofa in my coach has a real nice air pump you just click on and in about three minutes its inflated we use ours continually my friends our kids have all slept on it and they like it they do want to point out the wall sconces here and in the digital controller so this is kind of neat so from right here I can dim the lights maybe I'll get Zack to go back on them so you can see on the overhead light there over the dinette you can push that and then you can control the dimming how bright you want them turn the sofa lights off dinette I can turn all the lights off from here floor accent lights wall sconce can go down right there and then you could power everything up and you'll see as we go through the video or the video there's these controls are all out the coach and you also have a light master right here that'll turn all the lights off and then you can turn them all back on from right here so it's kind of a neat this multiplexing is kind of a neat feature well we're gonna go ahead and move well before we get up here I do want to point out the 110 outlet and USB the reason I keep going back to these things is these are the difference between enjoying your trip or not imagine you buy a Motorhome you don't have an outlet here your kids or your guests are sitting here and they're frustrated because their iPads or their Nintendo 3ds or whatever they can't charge it so by putting these here we're really trying to enhance your experience we also have overhead cabinets all right up in here before I move down into the cockpit I want to point out that this is where we would put your DirecTV here's your blu-ray DVD player your Weingard satellite system and this coach also has an in motion so it has both it has the high-definition large satellite that powers up just like a TV station would and then it also has an in motion satellite dome so you now have both of them on the same coach which is a really nice option we specify graded metal rather than glass to try to help keep the heat out of there that's an iws deal over here is some overhead controls I'll try to stand to the side here's your Magnum inverter this is your auto gen start as I mentioned this is all covered in our iws advantage videos here's your control system that we talked about earlier you know you can run the slides from here you can run exterior lights interior lights rear lights you have auxilary features so your engine preheat or your emergency start it's all located right here this coach is equipped with solar panels on the roof and this is a controller here and here's your heating and cooling controls so it's all nice at eye level you don't have to bend over to see it and then it's the driver side compartment there storage and I carry a satellite telephone so I've been requested in the 110 outlet up here so I can keep my cell light phone charged at all times well now we're gonna move down in here but before I get too low I want to point out some of the features up here you've got your sunglass holder whoops this is a nice storage compartment right here more light or sunglasses more storage here you've got your red light if you can see that and that's so if your passengers reading at night they say red light doesn't bother the driver and then you got your clear light or you have your brighter light right there here's the auto jack leveling system so when it's time to level this motorhome you just touch the power and hit Auto level and the hydraulic jacks come out and level it so just to give you an idea what the noise levels like I'm gonna go ahead and start this coach up you heard a couple buzzes so one of the buzzes is the collision mitigation going through itself check on it so I want to talk about some of the features I really cannot say enough about the seating position in these coaches yep it when you're sitting here looking out the front I got get my armrest down getting my traveling position I feel like I'm sitting in my pickup just higher I really like that I can see taillights coming on way down the road I got a really nice hood coming out here so I can really tell where I am in space the mirror position is just like in my pickup and this thing is just a dream to drive I tell everybody on a 2 or 3 hundred mile trip I don't think you could drive it faster in a pickup we these things cruise so nice this has tilt steering wheel as well as telescope so you can get the steering wheel exactly where you want it has the cruise control on and off accelerate decelerate and cancel has your marker interrupter button right here and what that does is it flashes your marker light so if you pass somebody and they turn their headlights on you can say thank you engine brake on/off right here I guess it's probably best for the engine brake for you to call in and have us talk you through all of those features but it's just a it's a feature that I would I would never order a truck without it never okay I'm gonna tilt the wheel down just a little bit over here on the door compartment you got your power windows up your door lock your power mirrors it's got a real nice grab handle right here and an easy to open door as I mentioned I we've started this truck up so you can really hear what the sound is like on it when you're sitting in it here's your oil gauge your axle temp your front differential temperature your rear differential temperature water heat rpm this Lane searching light is the forward-looking radar it's looking for the white lines on the road and when it's on it's telling you it's not picking them up here's your trip computer and everything in here speedometer oil pressure air dual air gauges as well as the air pressure on the rear airbags this parking brake here is for the trailer so you would never use this unless you're pulling a trailer this air button right here you pull out and that sets the parking brake and that does set the air brakes on both rear axles this is just your lighting control up and down emergency light in the step well where my feet are there's a light you can turn on and off here's your three stage engine brake low medium high  you have your exhaust regeneration your override shut down automatic traction control so you can run with that when you're running on slick roads and it'll automatically lock differentials your menu control back and forth for up here heated mirrors your docking lights that come on outside here's your fan control we got the fan running the air conditioning on and then here's all your power outlet now as we move up this is the air dump valve so we can lower the rear air suspension on this which you may want to do depending on you know where you're parking this locks the differentials together in a sense turns this thing into four-wheel drive by flipping them you can see here we have a left front tire that's 19 psi low so we lowered some of the air to set the alert on here so you guys could see that here's your transmission selector this little connection point right here is the USB so we have our halo 9 system that we're putting in this is a 9 inch flat screen it also has a backup capability I'll go ahead and put it in reverse and now you can see the backup camera there's my pickup sitting back there you can also turn the hitch guide on see the arrow right there you could turn the hitch guide off or alignment you can take there's all kinds of  things that you can do to program this thing you can play it through the blue way ray I'm going to put it back in neutral you can go you have apple carplay so you can plug your phone in it we we put a sub Sirius speakers in here and  a very large subwoofer this is something we're quite proud of and I really like this because the older I get the harder it is for me to see and having a real nice big touchscreen everything on here can be just swipe you know if I want to switch the Bluetooth I just go there you can always go back to your home button here go to auxiliary back to the home button you go through setup you can also run the camera you can you can turn the camera on while you're driving down the road so there's a lot of neat features here here's your collision mitigation this is going to give you a readout when you're coming up on somebody and tell you how close you are and as you get closer and closer to the vehicle alarms are gonna go off and there is a point where this thing will automatically apply park or automatically apply brakes to help prevent the collision you know they have a great video online at Bennett and I think it says two seconds matters and they were talking about how many accidents could be avoided if the driver just had two extra seconds of warning and that's what this is gonna give you right here trailer brake controller if you run air air brakes on it this seat has air valve or air bag underneath it so I'm gonna go ahead and lower it I can raise it if I want I've got fully adjustable armrests so you can set all these different levels on it once you set it and you put it back it always goes back to the same spot so here I'm gonna go ahead and put it at this angle I stow it and then when I put it back it's back at this angle so great adjustability there you also have the seat back adjustment on it as well the passenger seat does swivel around so you can be facing the other way as well as this one this is a little bit harder to pivot this one we typically only swivel around the passenger's seat we also have our iws drink holder and cell phone holder we're not showing it in the video some things we just kind of keep between us and our customers so there you are we've pretty much wrapped up the front now we're going to continue the tour down the motorhome I'm gonna go ahead and shut this thing off and here we go here's the midship private toilet Zack it's I'm just gonna let you go ahead and film in there see it has a lighted vanity around the edge of the counter mirrored medicine cabinet nice storage under the vanity got the macerator toilet in it with storage over the top we had a window installed in this one so let in some natural light now we're gonna go ahead and close out I'm going to turn right here point out the stacked washer and dryer right here these things work just like your home washer and dryer wood now we're gonna go into the the master bedroom so this has the renegade style wardrobe closet in it and I'm opening up all of these because so that you can see this is all pass through and renegades thinking was that you can slide clothes that maybe you don't need for a while here in the center and they'll slide in behind the TV and then the clothes you use on a more frequent basis will be out also notice how they stained clear to the back even if you were to look on the back side of the TV it's all finished lots of storage down here there's your satellite TV as well as your DVD and blu-ray player in this coach there's one two three four 110 outlets in the bedroom so we never wanted you to be far away from them you also have digital controller right here to turn the lights on and off so when you're laying in bed you could just reach up and turn them on and off lots of overhead storage here you can start the generator while you're laying in bed storage compartments nightstand so you can carry your you know your cell phone your pistol whatever you want we were water bottle right here beside the bed now I'm gonna go ahead and let Zack Cohen first into this bathroom because it is just breathtaking it's just something you would never expect to see in most motorhomes and it I think renegade just knocked this out of the park lots and storage in here vessel bowl sinks lighted leading edge on all of the countertops lots of medicine cabinets they keep using the word lots and spectacular but it's the only way I know how to describe this when you get into the shower over here there's a large sunroof over the top of it that's letting in a bunch of natural light they've got a built-in seat in it I know my wife really appreciates having that I'm gonna go ahead and sneak in here after he films the toilet the macerator actually probably be the best to get it across is just to open up the doors and let you see the size of this medicine cabinet there's another medicine cabinet here and then more here so there's lots of storage in here we also have his and hers outlets in the wall so you know if you have a cellphone or electric razor slide-out drawers this one's fixed you got storage underneath as well as storage over here these two drawers slide out I've already talked about the shower but I'm gonna go ahead and step inside so you can see as I mentioned I'm 6 foot with my hat on here there's still lots of room to get in here and shower I just wanted you to see the large linen closets that you have here just tons and tons of storage there's also a coat rack in here or a rod so if you want to hang more of your clothes well I hope you've enjoyed this video as I say in every video we just try to get better and better you know on this one we ran the air conditioning and generator the whole time trying to give you a sense of what it's like talk a little bit about price on this coach so we're asking five hundred and nineteen thousand dollars but due to our agreement with renegade we can't advertise the best price we can give you you'll have to call in for that well as they say in every video I really want to thank you for spending some time with us and and thank you so much for subscribing to our channel if you like this and you're not a subscriber it means a lot if you subscribe to us you know today it's a hundred degrees outside it's a little hard to dig deep to get out and film but when we when we see all the positive comments and we see the viewers and the subscribers it makes it all worthwhile so thanks again for your time and I hope to see you out on the road you [Music]",0
521,[Music] what's up guys welcome to Terry versus Bryan challenge number two now if you remember I kind of got worked in the first challenge and okay she just won but it resulted in some horrible chest waxing punishment that was not great but I'm coming back for my revenge so what we have today is we've got a five-part challenge so we're going to take it one event at a time first event is right here is a circus dumbbell for reps so we're gonna go one minute for reps Kerri has a 60 pound dumbbell and I'm gonna go with a 180 so mine is three times as heavy that's how we're kind of get a role with these challenges is to kind of equal out the weight so we can both do them and then the fun part is whoever loses gets a punishment yeah so I'm sticking with my original punishment because I still want one I haven't won and I want Kerri to get in the cold tub so that is you doing hot and Krystal has never happened yeah it hasn't happened but today it's going down so you got to get ready for that so that's your punishment and what is my punishment if I lose which I'm not going to if you lose we're gonna just do like a little face grooming eyebrow waxing maybe like a nice shave okay nose waxing I like I think they can do the inside of your nose the inside of my nose I think so I've heard it doesn't really hurt that bad I've never had a dog that sounds horrible it's how that sounds but it will be so clean after no all right so that you just heard what's not gonna happen so that's great I told that you have an advantage today so we'll see I'm gonna give him my all okay cuz I would love to see you get your nose wax all right and I'm sure they would love to get here well without without further ado let's get into challenge number one this dumbbell and what does see how this goes  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  [Applause] I'm almost sure that was 11 I think you oh my gosh whoo coming out of the gate you remove it I was hoping I could get ahead and then I was going right and left and I saw how fast you were going so I decided to drop the left and go with the right oh my god I know you'll always go right left right left yeah so so terrified then my right was gonna give out so I kept going back and forth the whole time yes I did find them I started that way oh my gosh prob about halfway through tens better than I thought I would do so I was a lot closer a lot closer than I wanted to be but I will take the I'll take the win one down one to go all right part two of the challenge is something a little bit more in my wheelhouse we are going to do Burpee box jumps max in one minute so what what are the rules Burpee box jumps and this is for Carrie for sure dumbbell now Burpee boxes all right rules are basically surreal simple chest and thighs on the ground okay stand up however you want jump up on the box and bring your hips through that's one rep and we're just going to do as many reps as we can in one minute so as you guys can see Carrie's box is a little bit higher than my box so this is my handicap for this challenge although I'm excited to test my conditioning I've been working hard on this conditioning so I have not been doing burpees but we will see we'll see for a minute for a minute I feel like I can I can try to keep up cheat if we went past a minute this would be no challenge at all but I'm gonna give you a run for your money yeah good game let's do it  up Oh  Oh  oh come on  ah  ah  oh I think I got 11 I think I don't know that was horrible I think I was loving qml was I think you've jumped on the box if I did the same number which I don't know if I did what did you video review but I think you got on the Box first do you think we did female rat stuff Dibley oh man I might as well be a loser well that's not very nice thanks we'll do a photo replay but I believe in 11 I was starting 12 I was on the ground for 12 I was on the ground too but I kept as on I knew I was a little bit behind ladies what call we'll call that a win for you all right time conditioning gets better though you got to give me that much better much better I see the veins copy what yeah those forearms are huge calm down with the compliments too much man all right guys three yeah  third event of the competition is going to be the tank push now this is something we have never actually done against each other but we we walk by and said you know what we should do some type of split you know fast challenge to just kind of test for you so the way that the tank actually works is there's a resistance that you can select so the weight on top doesn't actually matter it's actually the gearing of the tank so what we're gonna do is this is just a guess as well Terry's gonna go on level number one which is not a lot of resistance and I'm gonna go on level three which is the max resistance that you can do and hopefully that will kind of make it even basically what we got is we've got a course with two cones set out we've got to push this all the way down break the far cone run around to the other side and then push it back and then as soon as the front breaks this this cone then we're done so we're just going to time each other we're going to keep it honest with if you could even fair and see who can go faster  oh my gosh there's 1779 Oh God so my cause going so slow you totally know you were moving a little bit more a little bit more forcing leverage okay that was awesome here you go 1779 yeah kind of felt don't slow I think it was slower coming back I think you got there in maybe seven seconds oh really you're moving the I was nervous Suze you got down there all right so so that's two wins two for you two to one two events remaining yeah okay this is this is getting interesting oh good all right ready for the next challenge let's do it let's do it all right guys next is challenge number four and advantage is gonna be with Brian this time again I don't know if this is an advantage or not so what we've got is we're gonna do some loading so we both got a platform I have a road 250 pound sandbag and for cannery we've got this weighted ball that's uh that's 80 pounds here so obviously they're not both sandbags and carry is quite a bit shorter than me so I have a little bit of an advantage with the platform height all those sandbags a little bit harder to grab off the floor so are you doing like I do I do but I figured had to head this way we can look at each other and see who is winning and who's losing yeah I got to come back and tie it up the pressure is definitely on your shoulders because if I win this it's over I know I have Wow and you're getting in a cold tub I'm gonna fight with everything okay okay I feel like you're uh Tereus not just competitive ultra-competitive so there is no way she's going down without a fight so I'm a little nervous with this and I'm gonna need to bring my a-game to try to keep up with her here  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  [Music] Oh  [Music]  I'm gonna we have no idea let me do up I don't know what I really think I'm the head of you though oh yeah I think I'll whip yours is on top of money mines on the floor so I think you there's nothing else at except for the one up oh my gosh know how much fun how was up that's fine oh oh oh yeah yeah that's not literally I'm gonna keep that in my mind that's not happening I'm gonna keep cuz you're gonna be freezing no that's awesome just keep it keep it in there not happy good just get ready for it alright here we go refreshing here we go so it comes down to this literally we're tied two to two which means it's even and this challenge is kettlebell swings so what we have to do is race to 50 whoever whoever can get the fifty first the rules are basically you have to take it between your legs and it has to come up to face level is is a rep so basically that would be one rep and then you have to go 50 now the question is is whether or not we can do this unbroken or if we're gonna have to take a break or from a strategy standpoint if it'll be better to take a break in a certain number and I don't know when's the last time you did higher up kettlebell swings to be completely honest with you I don't really remember the last time I did kettlebell swings in general okay um I I'm nervous about this one not necessarily like the credible swing movement yeah but as you said Dwayne fifty it's for me it's going to be more of a mental being how deep can I go into that spot to go 250 or do I take a break and if I take a break how fast can I get back to the kettlebell yeah um well and to be do you have a strategy I I don't I mean I've I've done kettlebells for conditioning so you know I basically have done that done them four sets of 10 as part of kind of like a circuit which you guys have kind of seen with some of my training videos but not for high reps without taking a break so Terry's got 35 pounds I've got a hundred and six pounds so I think this is this is obviously a winner-take-all but if I had to call it I don't know and I think that's kind of why we picked that when we were when we were picking out these events and kind of agreeing to the challenge we wanted to pick something as a finisher if it was tied it would come down to this and um and we wouldn't know who would have the advantage obviously so what let's go first one to 51 sound good [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  No that is horrible [Music]  no way of knowing you know that yeah I know Pepe he may be all sound sound like no I don't have to speak no idea where you were oh my gosh how was impressive up that so much most you've ever done yeah never I've never got fifty in a row like that it's tough for me cuz my fingers I feel good but I kind of forgot about that when I was going in and I went to grab it knows pinkies wouldn't pitch so I pulled them out oh the first one you could swing right away and I had to kind of do like a loading to swing it and I was scared right from the start I was trying as much as I can to push the paper literally one rep one rep away it was close close the whole time generally close yeah was a good it was a good challenge yeah is it go challenge and now you're gonna look even more hero my gosh then you do already that is gonna be horrible I heard it's not that bad it's okay I've heard I'm sure your friend is going to be excited to see me again and it'll be wonderful we can throw in watching your chest again no no no no no that was not we're not adding that on to this the face waxing and noses it nothing I don't want to think about that I'm getting done with this one rep I don't know it was so close we couldn't have planned that better that wasn't true that was a true challenge I wanted a second there I wanted to say I was done so badly a newbie well I appreciate you being honest yeah it was definitely definitely the right channel oh my gosh well good job so much for victory this time around it was close it was close well that was fun it was super close the whole time you guys I have to say I'm very impressed with your condition it's better it's much better - better I'm very impressed good job yeah I mean I'm gonna come back and be you and something that's uh well do I do don't you did great so job anyways I think I think we're gonna wrap it up there hopefully you guys enjoy Terry versus Bryan number two and unfortunately the second round goes to carry as well congratulations but yeah what can I say my wife is awesome so it's tough fun tough to compete against her especially these challenges but I love having a wife that's competitive and it'll do this stuff with me and it makes life a lot of fun so anyway I hope you guys enjoyed the video for now go out and be great and we'll check you guys later [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  [Music],0
94,"after another huge month of boxing we take a turn from fights that could be to look at a few mishaps from the past that serve as a lesson to both present and future fighters a swift reminder that as we know you don't play boxing and so unlike a through the leg dribble in basketball or a step-over in football there are a few pretty obvious reasons that most should avoid showboating inside the squared circle  whilst Roy Jones rooster punch Ali's shuffle and Hammad's Lohan's all made for incredible viewing a short lapse in concentration for a lesser fighter could have devastating consequences  when she did here we look at five high-profile occasions where the showboating went very wrong welcome to a motive PDF presentation we'll start with the most recent where we head to Leicester England a vacant WBO title bout that became a viral sensation for one clear reason  Maxwell Maxwell and Sudhir II both entered the ring with almost identical ten and records in the early rounds the Frenchman seemed to be getting the better of Maxwell putting him down in the first and second surviving and early scare the Britt looked to regain some control though was seemingly on his way to a clear points loss that was however until the tenth and final round Sudhir he landed a clean few shots which led to careless showboating and dancing around the ring in pantomime fashion he had little hands chin exposed and with just 14 seconds to go Maxwell landed the shot of his career  a night that echoed a brutal reminder to fight until the final bell and then it's not over until it's Oh [Applause]  next we take a trip back 4 years ago to a night in Orlando Florida [Music] Felix beer dae-ho two years into his professional career and 14 and Oh at the time an Olympic quarter finalist who lost out the Lomo changer the Dale is not bad at all nice style talks up pretty good and with the warning signs of having ten knockouts already on his resume his opponent appeared to show little concern  happy to trade with the Puerto Rican it made for an exciting matchup early off  however only three rounds into the fight the gravity of the situation seemed to dawn on the Mexican landing more and more cleanly Verdejo took control avoiding a shot in one of those poker face Bluff moments Villanueva dropped his hands and taunted his opponent needless to say just five seconds later it came back to haunt him [Applause]  some of you love and some of you hate him but you know what just like boys mayweather he evokes emotions eight months prior at the end of 2013 we revisit that unforgettable night in Texas Adrien Broner 28 and Oh looked to be on the path to superstardom however against the rugged and heavy-handed Argentinian came the rude awakening that many believed he needed December 14th we weren't about Maidana you know um I respect this coach I respect him as a fighter but December 14 mama beat his ass though swarmed from the opening bell Maidana put pressure on him immediately and in a moment of disrespect Broner taunted his opponent at the end of the first another gesture which would come back to haunt him later in the punishing to the body and head Maidana landed the left hook in the second that floored Broner for the first time in his career and despite seeming to recover mid fight round eight saw another looping left hook send him down  knocked out twice yeah black power winning by unanimous decision came a satisfying victory for the Argentinian and watching Broner leave the ring without congratulation or being interviewed was clearly a huge reality check for the American okay you know it happens to the best of them in and it doesn't eat even as of right now I'm still one of the best moving back still we remind another 18 months to Quebec Canada at the Bell Centre in front of 15,000 fans the unbeaten bootay came in against Olympic bronze medalist Edison moraga you know I don't think they need to count loans and it's neat to make sure that they win the fight looking this sharper and smarter fighter bouquet looked comfortable during the first couple of rounds moving well and unloading flurries of punches where his Colombian opponent looked to land power shots frustrated and having little success me Rhonda tried to get into his opponents head taunting bouquet at the ending bell of the first been carelessly dropping his hands in the third and just like the fighters featured previously we know how this ends hands on hips stood up straight Miranda suffered a careless lapse of concentration and false confidence regaining stance and walking forwards he found himself immediately on the receiving end of a vicious left  [Music] and did not see that coming didn't expect it yeah they love  [Music] last up a night 15 years ago in California that saw the collision of two solid lightweights two fighters that had been beaten previously but still had a lot at stake in what was always destined to be an all-action fight the pace was high from the get-go despite landing some crisp flurries of punches early on Hayden saw himself fading in the middle rounds as Campbell the bigger puncher of the two looked to be capitalizing piling on the fresh searching in five looking to be on his way out Hayden was caught with a sickening body shot doubling over in obvious pain  knowingly hurt kampl grew more and more confident with little return fire coming his way just 20 seconds later the American dropped his hands playing with his opponent and right on cue the Australian unloaded the biggest left hook of his career  another instance where one single punch and split second reaction can completely flip a fight on its head played with his opponent who's completely confident with his hands down hit right on the chin with a perfect left hook and with  five harsh reminders that boxing is not for the faint-hearted and that no matter the circumstances to fight to the final peg regularly we see fighters take matters into their own hands though with the continued revival of the flashy style displayed by fighters like lomachenko Kelly and Saunders comes the harsh reality of what could happen in a moment of negligence [Applause]

485,"hi guys thanks for tuning in to another video on Forgotten weapons comm I'm Ian and I am here with a pretty cool gun that has been provided for this video by modern arms out of Tempe Arizona suburb of Phoenix this is a GE m134 minigun and i'm sure everyone's familiar with having seen these but i bet a lot of people don't really know how they work or where they came from so a little bit of background on this thing these were actually first developed as a 20 millimeter rotary aircraft armament and the reason that they are called mini guns today is because when ge developed this one they scaled it down from a 20 millimeter aircraft cartridge to this little tiny 308 round and at that point it becomes the mini version of the gun now actually development goes back a little bit before that that was 1950s but in fact experiments with electrically powered Gatling guns and that's what this really is go all the way back to the 1890s you can in fact find it's really cool you can find articles from magazines in the 1890s talking about Gatling guns with electrical power firing at these astonishing rates of fire like 3,000 rounds a minute literally as fast as they fire today they were able to do prior to 1900 the reason is an electrically driven motor will run this gun as fast as you want to run the motor now the obstacle back in the you know 1900 was you couldn't just have electricity anywhere and where these guns were considered or powered Gatling guns were considered at that time period was his naval defense because on a large naval vessel you had a turbine always running that was providing electrical power and so you could hook the gun up to that at that point you didn't have vehicles driving around that you could put power you know connect the power from and certainly you can't run this as an infantry weapon because you need electricity and in 1900 you don't have electricity to just kind of carry around like that so they never they were never really successful at that point people opted for other other mechanisms and at that point they were never belt-fed they were typically running Ackles drums or Broadwell drums or some other existing Gatling feed mechanism and at 3,000 rounds a minute any of those go dry really fast if you're gonna run this effectively you really need a belt feed that's what we have in this and that's what made these practical in the 1950s so power wise these things run on 24 volts DC and they run now your power consumption depends on your rate of fire because this is a totally electrically operated gun it's not recoil operated it's not gas operated it's operated by an electric motor so it'll run it whatever rate of fire you want it to and your power consumption for three to four thousand rounds a minute is gonna be about a kilowatt in half and that's quite a lot of power you're not getting that with double A's or cr123 batteries you need basically a pair of car batteries hook together and that's on one of several reasons why whenever you see these things in Hollywood being carried around and fired from the hip or whatever completely bogus the first reason it's bogus is because you're the guys not carrying you know 100 pounds of batteries with him the second reason it's bogus is he's not carrying the ammunition with him because at 3,000 rounds a minute you're firing 67 rounds per second  you're go through a lot of ammo and that you need somewhere to store it and it weighs a lot and of course the recoil force you're talking literally hundreds of pound feet of recoil impulse from this thing this is equivalent to fire your 308 rifle 3,000 times in a minute or 67 times in the second adding all that recoil up and delivering it to the shooter so that's why they're always on fixed mounts now originally these were aircraft armaments specifically helicopter armaments in Vietnam and they were fantastic in that role that's where they really shine because in say an you know an attack Huey you can stick this thing on a nice fixed mount guys got a nice open field fire out the door ammo just goes in a couple of crates inside the helicopter you can plug into the helicopters turbine engine get all the power you need and the real advantage of this the reason that you want 3,000 rounds a minute is because when you're flying past someone you have a very limited window in order to engage a target and so what you had to do you know the better the gun was the more bled it could deliver to the target in that one second or two seconds that were available this is something that you'll also see in standard aircraft machine guns for example a ground mount browning 1919 run said five or six hundred rounds a minute the aircraft version they make a bunch of changes and crank that up to like 1,200 rounds a minute because again you have these very short engagement windows and when you are on target you need to put as much lead downrange during that brief moment as you can that's where this shines all right so the way that these actually work is there we have a couple main components here we have a barrel cluster we have the actual power source the the motor that runs the gun and then the most complex and really in some ways the most important element to the gun is this structure here which is the DES linker so this gun is fed via a standard belt of 308 ammunition normal links m60 links and what you have to do is have a way to take the rounds off the belt and then feed them into the rotary system of the Gatling gun so I've taken a cover plate off here so we can see the actual workings of the gun and what we have are six barrels and six bolts and you can see depress this you can see that the the barrels rotate through and we're kind of getting the boring section here but right here is where they're closing with a new cartridge they're firing right about here and then the bolt get scammed backwards by this track to extract the cartridge so we're getting a feed down in this area comes up chambers locks fires at 10:00 or 11:00 o'clock on the clock face and then extracts and ejects and you can actually hear the firing pin  so the firing mechanism the actual barrel cluster is in some ways it's not that complex and it's actually extremely similar to a vintage 1870s Gatling gun what makes it different is the DES linker alright so this is a separate D linking mechanism and this is definitely the most complex part of the actual gun so what we have going on here is right here is the entryway where the belts coming in so when this is on the gun it's gonna be kind of in this orientation with this solenoid sticking up out of the top but what we're looking at here is our links are gonna come in here our belts going to come in here and what we have to do is actually push the cartridges forward off of the links or straight through the links so most machine guns pull the cartridge out the back this is going to push it straight through straight forward through the link and it's going to be hooked up to the motor by this gear and we can see it best okay so right up in there at the top of travel you can just see the pushers starting to come through as I rotate this what's gonna happen is rounds coming here at the top of this mechanism they start to get pushed out of the links and then we come to this side they get pushed forward into this silver spindle and what's interesting here is this spindle actually holds two cartridges one above the other when it's operating so when a cartridge is first stripped off the belt it goes into the very bottom of this cutout and it's then going to go all the way around this circle and end up on top of this it's kind of like a snail shape surface here so when the cartridge goes down it's on the underside when it comes up it's writing on top of this surface and right about here it gets transitioned off into the gun so the best way for me to demonstrate this is to actually just put some ammo in it so there is no firing pin mechanism in it or anything in this this is just the D linker and it would be a little bit better if I had these on links but I can manually cycle it with my thumb if they're just loose rounds and you'll get the idea of how this works so I put a couple rounds in there and then I have the exposed gear so we can start to pull them down a couple more in there fill it back up now if we look down here we're gonna start to see these come through so there's our first projectile coming through and as I said it's going to come up inside here so these cartridges are in the bottom of this boy I don't know all the terminology for this gun bottom of that spindle and then they're going to rotate around there we go no now you can see we have this cartridge on the top and we've got another one coming in right below it right there just in time this one comes up now it can actually come out it's sitting on top of this surface and in the top of the spindle and right in here the D linker hands this cartridge off to the actual barrel cluster to fire  and that is how your minigun feeder or D linker works when those links when the rounds are pushed out of the links the links are gonna come out this little feed chute kind of directed away from the rest of the the works of the gun to keep it clean but that's where the links will come out and we'll see that in just a moment in some firing footage so the trigger mechanism here being that this is an electrically fired gun it's got an electric trigger mechanism make sense right a bunch of different stuff going on we have this plug which connects to our master power and then a safety switch that turns power on or off to the gun and of course when you knock this down you're going to turn the gun off light just confirms that you have power running to the gun these are your triggers you can fire the gun with either one of them you don't have to have both depressed and then interestingly you have another one here this button is actually set up to connect to your communications so if you're the door gunner in a helicopter or if you're you know Humvee or something that has this mounted on it pushing this activates your radio it's the equivalent of reaching to your microphone and what this allows you to do is keep both hands on the gun and still be able to communicate which is important when you're the one directing this kind of firepower all right so firing procedure lifts up the safety engage master power lights on although you can't see it in the sunlight and now we're ready to go one of the interesting side effects of an electrically powered gun like this is the barrels don't just stop the moment you release the trigger they're going to the motor stops and then the barrels spin down until they stop from friction you do want to make sure that you don't have say all of your ammo continue to feed through the gun while the barrels spinning right so you don't have you know fifty or hundred rounds dump out the side of the gun while the barrels are slowing down and that is done in one of two ways the original mechanism was actually a mechanical a solenoid on on the feeder and with those you would actually lose about 5 loaded rounds when you stop firing they would spit out the ejection port and the reason for that was that they were in the gun cluster at the time the more modern way which companies like Dylan have have developed is to actually put a clutch on the thing that disconnects the feeder earlier and with a Dylan clutch on it you don't lose any live ammo that was one of their selling points so you know I can fire up like a one-second burst and I'm getting about a one-second spin down a little more than a one-second spin down when you're actually shooting these something to keep in mind is that they don't really like quick repeat taps of the trigger so give it a moment to spin down before you fire it again otherwise you're kind of inviting feed jams when these guns do jam it's primarily this guy it's the the D linker that's going to give you problems and you don't want to have to pull this thing apart to clear a malfunction you just want to keep shooting it so in general firing these give it a burr you doesn't have to be a long burst but don't try and fire stop and then immediately fire again all right before we can shoot it we have to load it up now of course we have this feed chute that doesn't what this does is simply guide the belt and prevent where there's a cloth cover on here to prevent links from getting stuck in the belt this just keeps everything nice and clean so I'm gonna go ahead and disconnect that then this is our ammo can and this is I believe a thousand round ammo cam got some half-turn locks and we can take the lid off and you've got it divided into two segments here and there's a trick to getting the thousand round continuous belt all loaded in here just perfectly so it'll feed without any snags now we're gonna load I believe I think we're into a 200 round belt this time so we're not really gonna need to mess with this we can use just the cover so let me put this back on what I'm gonna do here is pop the top of this and what this this funnel is here so that you can feed from either this side or this side and the belt will slide into the center position where it goes up into the feed chute we've got a plastic nice low friction roller there so put our feed chute on there we go lift up the top cover as with US military machine guns we want the brass facing down or as they say brass to the graphs what's kind of cool about this is because these are contained in the feed chute I can actually push this belt and it'll push rounds all the way up that shoot up to the gun all right I can see the end of the feed chute or the end of the belt up in the chute there so I have just a little bit of belt left which has gotten bent I had it twisted down there and bent a link so it is important on a minigun that you do not have a trailing link like this because that will mess up the that will jam up the D linker so I'm gonna put a loose round in that trailing link and then we'll just slide there because I have so little belt down in the can I don't need to worry about making sure that it's folded right it just barely even hits the bottom of the cam so go ahead and close this lock it down now we're ready for the next step of loading rotate the barrel till the clutch will open up all the way okay now by pinning this in place it will allow me to rotate the barrels which I have to do to manually feed the belt in at first so I've got my belt down here we're gonna lift it up we want to make sure that everything goes in perfectly straight and parallel here you don't want the rounds nose-diving forward or back and so we've got it all the way up I'm gonna maintain some upward pressure rotate the barrel cluster counterclockwise which will rotate the d-link or clockwise and pull that first round up until I hear a click there's one click we want to clicks so maintain pressure make sure these are still nice and even  there's our second click now the D linker is holding the belt under its own strength I can let go with the belt I'll go ahead and put this back in place and now I want to continue to click the barrel cluster through until I see a first the first link come out of the feed chute there now we're going to continue to click this through until the first link comes out the feed chute once that happens we'll know that the belt is all the way through the D linking process okay there we go very important now we remove the pin and reengage the clutch if I don't do this ammo will continue up into the barrel cluster and after a couple of clicks it will actually fire around as long as the clutch is engaged here now the barrel stays still and what we'll be doing here is just cycling the belt up and in until the gun is completely ready to fire and now you saw the second link came out now we're all the way through the D linking cycle and I can click the barrel around as much as I want because the clutch is engaged ammo is not feeding into the gun at this point however the gun is hot and as soon as you turn on power and press the triggers the clutch when you press the trigger the clutch disengages and allows the gun to actually fire alright here we go master power on that was a little high  and that's a hundred rounds so there isn't an iron there isn't an optic on this gun and you actually you aim it by watching impact and the trickiest part about that is it fires so fast that you run out of ammo you have to be pretty fast to pick up okay where where am i hitting adjust with a regular machine gun 500 rounds a minute it's not that hard to go well okay you know duck duck and bring it on to target with this thing by that time you fired at 250 round belt already it's gone so you have to get some pretty quick reaction times on this which means that I need some more practice on it I normally don't shoot at goofy targets like old trucks but the minigun is kind of a different beast and kind of requires something like that so I'm gonna see if I can actually hit that  we're gonna start low bring the GUP gun up on to target powers on  well I was hitting it there shall we go take a look and see what happened so as a guy without a whole lot of experience shooting a minigun I was able to successfully perforate the snot out of this truck including both of the tires and I think there is going to be an attempt to set this thing on fire which will be made very easy by the fact that the gas tank is now also thoroughly perforated and drizzling out on the ground so I'm gonna stay a little farther back from it than this it is interesting to note that that rate of fire actually makes it kind of hard to shoot because you have so little time to to track your target and engage before you're just out of ammo so we can't take some actual a little bit of real-world lesson from a goofy exercise like this namely you'll notice that I have bullet holes pretty well distributed across the front of the truck including a bunch here on the front blew out that tire however if we look at the back side of the truck we've got a lot of bullet holes coming out the back but we don't really have any coming out the front here got to there in front of the tire and one clearly went low enough to actually puncture the tire but while I wouldn't say there is any safe way to hide behind this from a minigun you'll die a little bit later if you hide behind the engine block  thanks for watching guys I hope you enjoyed the video I'd like to really thank modern arms out of Tempe Arizona for letting me get my grubby hands on this thing show you guys how it works and show you guys what it looks like actually shooting tune it again to forgotten weapons calm and have some fun  you",0
217,I've been asked how I am finding water when I dig a well it's pretty simple what I use many people disagree with it say it doesn't work I'm not here to change anybody's mind I'm just telling you what I use and what works for me and again this is only for shallow wells something both let's say no deeper than 30 feet and my secret weapon is coat hangers dowsing rods and what I use to make these work correctly so I don't have to wonder from my thumb or fingers are helping or that it's rotating correctly drinking straws take a drinking straw cut it in half slide it over in slide it over and I don't let my thumbs touch I don't grab tight and hold it don't let my fingers rub on this you want it just to come up and they're very easy to rotate within these straws you want to keep them  perpendicular to the ground or just up pointed down just slightly because you don't want to work against and I'll go out as I'm about to do another well out where my I have some bees and I need to make sure that they're having plenty of water and it's further that I want to tote it every day and I'll have a further demonstration once we get out there  I've marked that spot  okay what's happening here is real interesting it happens every once in a while I'm getting hit on a line which means to me which has been my experience there is an underwater stream right here  it might make more sense if I come in this way again it's kind of comfortable perpendicular to the ground just a little bit lower walk up they start to cross now just kind of like put a foot marker right here which means I could dig anywhere on this line and I'm gonna hit water because there's a stream of sorts running underneath here the other thing that will happen occasionally is  instead of them crossing we get a little closer instead of them crossing like this you may go pass something and both of them go like this or like this in me is I need to go that direction back towards where the water is and once I start going that way they will cross again a lot of times this will point you in the direction that you need to go now sometimes it I've done this where I can't find anything I mean I'm not getting any hit this just so happens it has bit this has been about the easiest I did I started and as soon as it I started getting hits on the water and I bet if I start going across like this probably about three or four more feet it's going across there direct line so since I have been fortunate enough to find what I believe to be blowing water underneath here I'm going to try to find a spot that's convenient for me  particularly point sand that's the way it is been for the whales that i didÃ¤Ã´t another part of the property so what convenient for me this area because I can keep it out of the way and it's convenient so let's see what back we'll come back up on that line  okay scuff in the ground back here  I get another line I'm just gonna pick me a spot I'll pick me a spot this could be on this line now that we got everything ready start on our wheel  [Music]  okay thanks to pay attention to as you're digging as I started it's very sandy here of course as you see but I got down to a little over five feet in the sand it's changing color SEC I mean I'm getting to a different kind of sand I'm getting to clay whatever but when you're digging pay attention to the changes in the color of what you're digging because that can give you clues as to what you're about to get into weather getting closer to water whether you dig somewhere else around on your property you may have an idea of what to expect and the difference between the original auger with having to use a pipe wrench and everything to take stuff up with this method right here making these extensions out of square bar tubing just move sprinkly up they handle off  but extension here reattach spring clip  put your handle back on  but just friend clip in and you're ready to keep rolling  so we're down a little over 10 feet now it's starting to get into the clay and usually you get there you get to the other side of it and in that sand on the other side of the clay or Rock that's where you get to start getting water so I anticipate anytime  this thing's starting to get a little bit wet  it's also important that you try to keep things straight up and down perpendicular you starkey crooked you're gonna have problems putting your pipe in later on  what we're done about now 13 feet we've started to hit water not late it's really really wet with really rough sand mixed with it squeeze it out here's a tip especially if you're working by yourself because this can get 50 dog Oh heavy get to the point we help control this thing if you've made one of these with the detachable pieces the square tubing just take the handle off it doesn't seem like that weighs a lot but you don't have to balance it up in there and it makes it a whole lot easier  and you don't have to worry about hitting you ball head on the way down  there you go when you get in the water there's gonna be a lot of suction and it is not gonna want to let you pull this up so to help get it started you need to do is you need to twist and pull at the same time to break that suction loose and that's a little harder to do when you're trying to pull the handle off so you'll just have to work out it's all by feel you'll feel it let go like I said right now I'm pulling up on it and twisting and it is not letting go  okay there we go knows a part of the joys of working place okay we're finished not that you can see anything down in there there's our varying bits of soul I wanted to go deeper I'm about eighteen feet which is not very deep but I got four feet of water in the hole but here's the reason I went ahead and stopped and this is from experience this right here there's green clay this is out of focus clay and you get in this and it goes on for a while and it is tough and it is slimy and it is a lot of work and I'm not gonna gain anything by killing myself going any further I just need to be able to get a little water out of this thing to take care of my bees and water a plant or two around here with old cistern pump so oh one more thing  this is why you pay attention when you dig it's broken right off in here that's oh it's an old spearhead that came up find lots of arrowheads and spearheads around here this is one he came up about I don't know I was about four or five feet down and got it well next we're gonna put our pipe in the hole okay here's our PVC casing pipe that's gonna go on the ground it's about 20 feet long because I got about a four foot water table in the hole I just come up from the bottom a little bit get this in you'll get our pea gravel around it and we'll pack dirt back around it and our casing pipe will be finished under then capping it off and then we will put our pump pipe in okay so we just about ready now what I like to do when I fill the hole back in of course first put the pipe in then I put the pea gravel in to be higher than the level of the notches I cut in the the four inch PVC then I start replacing the soil that came out of the ground and what I do is I start from this and me from what came out last and work my way up to what came out first as you can see I haven't got half way through and I'm already full you know also like this one here sometimes I do it beforehand I will clean around the bottom of the the hole where I'm digging this one here was a lot of nice grass and I just left it there now I'm through digging the hole and I'm filling in I go in and I've chopped all the the grass around it I'll pack this here down and then we're going to cap it with concrete a bag or two of sack Creek should be fine and what that does that causes the water not to be able to run down into your well it will run around it it's just another way to seal it off we get that done and hopefully tomorrow we will be able to get the get our other pipe in and go ahead and put the pump on  once it gets close to the Bob you'll feel it once the slack goes out of it you've hit the bottom there's mine I'm at the bottom so what I like to do is take it and tie myself a little knot right there so I know where the top of my case is let's bring it back up  right about there so  I've got almost four feet almost four feet of water in there so what I need to do is measure this cord from the end of the top and be about one foot shorter because we don't want the bottom of our whale pipe to be touching the bottom of our case and being say it I've already cut my pipe these shallow wheels this is one of the most important things that you can have to save you all kinds of trouble this is a foot bowel and what it does is it allows water to come into your pipe and it will not come back out so your pump will always stay Prime so then the next thing we need to do is lower this down in our whale  and I'm using one-inch pipe on this piece together this is a scrap whale  okay what I don't want to do lose this  you know I can grab it  the other thing I've done is like went and got a flat a four inch flange for a drain or a toilet it's gonna be easy to sit to stay in there and then just kind of forward to set on top nice let that thing sit right in there down nice and tight okay it does not get any easier than that right there so as far as your well being you're done with with this part you don't have to worry about stabilizing or anything then your pitcher pub one thing would be easier to do is it go ahead and prime it go ahead and get water in that pipe so you're not fighting to bring it up water down in our pie  I'm hoping that's enough water I may not have got enough but then we'll take our picture pop attached to the top of our pie  we'll see we got enough in their prime  and we don't I might get some more water to help this thing get prize okay we had to get some more water because I have enough to private thing but we I look at this as a good training example not to freak out if it doesn't work there's not water and you can prime right through your pitcher club to just open it up and pour through  you're gonna have to pump and pump and pump until you get rid of all that because that's all the stuff to spend disturbed at the bottom it will take a while eventually it will clear now what I do  so I have to worry about this thing moving I'm just going to attach it to my block up here  it's good to go and if you notice the being started I already I put my concrete at the bottom and the reason for that is twofold one you want to keep your whale clean you don't want brown rock water running in it bring your contaminants in but to think about this way you have opened a hole in the ground exposing water down there you want to be a good steward and not let stuff get nasty so you're you're not only keeping your well water clean but you're keeping water clean and other people may end up using so now we'll just let this thing sit get it cleaned up in my job is to pump this thing get it cleaned out and we've got another wheel okay we're gonna wrap all this up we've got it installed we got it aground we're getting water I still need to clear mine but we're not going to do that here I just want to close this up with a few tips to help you in some problems that may come up with all this that seemed to come up with all of them one make sure all of your connections your your PVC glued connections your teflon tape connections all those are tight if not they will leak a little bit you'll loose Prime and you'll have problem with your pump too if your pump after doing it this way and having the foot valve on the bottom if it continues to loose prime probably what's happened is the dirt or sand or whatever that's in the bottom of the Year whale has gotten into the foot valve and it's keeping it from closing all the way which is allowing water to run back out it's not a big deal pull this off pull your pipe out take that foot valve apart there's one screw it takes out you can clean it out get the sanded junk out put it back together drop it back in it should be fine  finally keep a bucket or a container of water near your pump until it is given you continual water it can be quick prime of this thing where you can continue going and eventually hopefully you'll have one that you don't have to worry about I've got one of those around here it stays primed all the time so good luck what you dig in hope this helps um and I'm gonna get out of here because it's starting to rain happy digging,0
90,I heard you get us bad real bad we're gonna quality work and you know T building two we'll call it that see what it looks not even if you want to quit then just say I quit and you're done okay I'm going to try to get each and every single one of you guys quit today and it's probably take about 20 minutes for the first person goes  okay from here from here we're going to change out you guys will immediately go into the ocean okay  welcome to buzz this is an Olympic water pool anymore this is a step in the model world okay so from here we'll change out we're going to go play some ocean games for an extended period of time  just 2005 I was like the Plymouth with the army we were hitting a target on the border between Baghdad and Fallujah I was walking point for the element at the time which this means I was the first guy in the line I hopped over a wall I was making my way to a front door and I got shot in the hip from about 12 feet away by an Iraqi insurgent and it was myself in a courtyard and two other Navy guys both of the other name you guys will also wounded at the same time I was basically laying flat on my back and underneath the vehicle at the time and the army guys would not come over the wall to help us but the two Navy guys who were not engaged in the firefight knowing that they were protected by maan the wall came over the wall and drugged me out of the courtyard and the rest of the guys out there so teamwork that's what teamwork means to me they instead of just talking about how there's no I in team and our courage commitment and you know buddies till the end and all that they hopped over a wall when people were trying to kill us and pull this out of there and I think that directly relates to the training in the background that we all have because I know all those guys I'd known him for years I've worked with him every single day they were on my team that's what being a team means in the seals you're willing to sacrifice yourself for your friend that's what it means it's a little bit harder than the sporting environment because you guys are going for it's not life and death you know you're going for physical dominance of a sport or in this case shooting for an Olympic gold medal right doesn't mean you guys can't sacrifice yourselves for each other just like those guys did for me it's just the setting what you're doing it so I think it's more than mindset that people have when they leave this place that's important and I think that's the biggest change of people and have for themselves and they come here  or advice  I want you guys going out to be deep water  ah  I notice you guys are laughing right now so we'll just stay out here so everybody's quiet  pepper on the tree  praise the beach  forward march Beauregard  and so if you can just zoom over this shit you not do this to the rest today we will stay up here still want to put so we can even get out now are we to stay on your marker  you have one minute 30 seconds go  squat bill squat seat back push-up feet up underneath jump everybody got it all right Tony when I tell you to I want you to do a burpee as fast as you can okay you know  two seconds so there's a deal you guys can give me 30 good buddies in one minute and we will move on to do of course standby good  oh good push-up all you guys are doing this forgotten you guys want to count it vigilant where's the team the one Scout as a team and who wants to count as an individual nante the other two I would go first Chuck hey you guys figure it out Oh same as you guys look like shit right now half you guys are doing one part of the exercise half you guys are doing another part so since I'm a man of my word we will stagger until I get 30 burpees in the time allowed you gotta figure it out but we literally will be there for hours people doing push-ups and you have all the people jumping at the same time if you're gonna do it as a team do it as a team ah yes here we go mess this one up we'll go back to the surf  stopping to do it stand up so Tony if I told you guys that I wanted you to do this as a team what I look at you it should look like one person voting right does it look like that write it up this let's go  right you do not walk it bud we're on it bud  Oh  suffered South Islander yell out put your head back  right  don't have a buddy statute yeah you guys have a one minute to be at the obstacle call that dirty name 20 burpees what I watch you guys do this if you guys if you chose to count as a team I want you to move this Tim yes you deploy that there's gonna lead to D hey guys yeah step up and leave that you do and 3 2 1 go 1 2 3 1 2 3  $15 gun what are you doing right there why did you just stop it get the Bourbon  you don't to quiz me explain it to your team while you're started -

316,in big cities like Vancouver the need for affordable housing is obvious it's not always so evident in smaller rural communities though today we've traveled to Grand Forks and British Columbia to meet an inspiring man who is making big waves in a small city with a tiny house [Music]  hello Peter thank you very sleazy to meet you manager to meet you and how wonderful to see your gorgeous tiny house I was actually surprised at just how small it is when I saw it this is a very tiny tiny house isn't it it's a bit extreme what size is it actually it's 125 square feet inside I've always enjoyed building and small spaces and the creativity of trying to fit things into a smaller space and a couple of winters ago I was volunteering at a cold-weather shelter in Grand Forks and I was asked at that time if I would help design some spaces for the homeless and as I started thinking about that project and how to make a very inexpensive but really welcoming space for somebody who was homeless and was transitioning through that I realized that it just didn't seem right to design something that I hadn't really experienced living in and I had never experienced living in this kind of space and basically just decided that it'd be fun to build one and see what it was like to live in it and then how to make it work as you know a pod for a homeless person to transition through and the majority of the materials are found and that's one of the values I put into the building is that it be recycled repurposed and yeah that's basically how I got here that's the design process you have a background in advertising don't you yeah this is a long way from that well it's a long way from that world  what was that transition actually like for you because obviously the advertising world it's very based on material acquisition and encouraging people to desire more things and what you're really doing with this project is the exact opposite of that isn't it its opposite of that so in advertising and I've done a lot of construction and house design stuff like that in both of those I've tried to educate as well and so mine hasn't all been about acquisition and stuff I've always built small houses and I've chose what I want to advertise so it's maybe not that far away so I say that you eventually called the project my pad can you tell me a little bit about what that is I did a demonstration or a talk for the City Council trying to explain the tiny house movement and I didn't want them to immediately see my place as this tiny little sardine can and so I wanted to come at it from a different angle and so I talked about Apple having miniaturized a house and created this small house and we had the first one here in Grand Forks and it let them just forget reality for a minute and then I could talk about the small house movement and they could hear me and then I told them about fake news  yeah and it was good it made it understandable for them yeah so you know there's that advertising background going to work for you but if it actually opened the doors and you've actually made some really impressive headway with the council here in Grand Forks heaven here yeah we've got a really progressive council the planner and the building inspector and engineers are all together on small housing and sustainability in this so yeah it's a it's an exciting time right now for me well I'm very excited to have a look inside the place and see what you've done well then come on in welcome wow what an adorable space I'm really intrigued to learn about the design of this home this is a very small tiny house for full-time living how did you design the space to really work for you I started out trying to make a space that would work for anybody and halfway through decided no this is for me and I started coming up with my own parts to it it's always not seemed wise to me to have a door at the end because then you're using up a lot of floor space that isn't useful whereas this coming in from the side all of the floor space has another purpose and also I wanted very light weight and so I did the post and beam which is structurally really strong but also really light so the walls are really lightly framed what's through this door here that's the bathroom this is your bathroom out of here and that kind of made sense because it was as far away as possible from the bedroom the kitchen right and all of my plumbing and electrical and propane and everything is out that end so it's the most efficient use of the plumbing and wiring and etc perfect well can we have a look inside you bet this is really Nate the tub actually looks like it's a great size it's very deep it is deep enough that I can sit in it and have the water come up to my chest and be able to soak and I don't know if you've noticed it's a recycled freezer really yeah it's a little freezer I went up to the local landfill where they have a bunch of old freezers backed up and I sat in a bunch of different freezers until I found one that was right size for me and then you've got the composting toilet there as well yep and I've got a separate unit in there and then you're heating your water using gas propane propane yeah I love the idea of not having a tank of hot water remaining hot for a day or two well I don't use it you know it seems so wasteful so I love I love this and then over here we're moving into your kitchen and office area and everything else this is my solar fridge this is all set up for solar I'm not using the panel's right now I've got them stored because I'm in this tree blind place that I have the Sun showing but everything here is set up to be off-grid great both water and electricity and everything so this is a unit a fella in Mount best in Australia made this prototype for me 410 to adapt a chest freezer into a fridge right it's really efficient and of course when I open it the cold air doesn't fall out it's not quite as convenient as a stand-up fridge sure but I don't mind I get it's just it just trickles the power yeah that is such a clever idea because of course if you are on solar power the fridge is one of the hungriest appliances that's right house exactly anything to do with heating or cooling takes a lot of powers so actually having a super efficient unit like that it's a very clever idea yeah and in the kitchen over here you've got a good amount of space to work with for cooking yeah I find it quite adequate for me there's enough counter space plus I have the counter space over here that I can use and I don't think I've ever used two burners at the same time so it's more than enough there and seems to do me just fine you've actually allocated quite a large amount of the space of this home to your office haven't you yeah as it's turned out this is more of my living room than my original thought of a living room that if I have somebody over we usually sit here at the desk and we'll eat here that's the kitchen table as well and so it's kind of my great room you've really hit the jackpot when it comes to your parking space as well I mean the views that you get into we're looking right out onto that gorgeous River right now yeah this is a fabulous parking spot yeah it's beautiful waking up and I just sit up and have my coffee in bed and look out at that river and you know watch the deer walk the deer walk through there and they munch the ground and beavers go by with their sticks I mean it's just incredible and then you'll lounge spaces down the end can we have a look at that you betcha  now this is such a clever idea are we actually on your bed right now we're on the bed yeah so I designed this idea with the cushions where I've had five people sitting up here pretty comfortably nice distance for conversation I've enjoyed that once I found out that I don't actually entertain in my house much I go to the library I'll go to the coffee shop go to the pool etcetera you know that and that's what if somebody says you want to get together we'll go have dinner or something and so I don't set this up anymore unless somebody comes over and then does it take a long time to actually pack this all down to get into it it's moving for cushions out into the utility room it takes the amount of time it takes to walk out there and then have you also built storage and under the space yep I've got a slide-out bin underneath and all my bagging and winter clothes and boots and all that stuff are under there what's it like living in this home I love living here and the freedom of this place I don't have to think about maintenance when I'm gonna have to replace the roof cleaning I started go and it's done it I have so much time now and the cost of running this place is just about zero I've got a really low parking fee here i hook into her power at the big house and my bank accounts growing just from my pension you know my government pension it's actually growing that's you know it is crazy it never occurred to me that I wouldn't own my own own a house or a few I've often owned a few houses while I've been building and I've sold all of my property and houses and everything this is everything I've got right here and I don't think I can explain the liberation of not having a house on me if I don't like the location I'm at I can move to another one if I want to go travelling for a year I can go traveling for a year there isn't a cost of letting it just sit and I think the favorite thing of living in this tiny house for me is just the freedom and can I ask what the budget for this project I'd never occurred to me to have a budget I did keep all my bills but I haven't yet looked at them but my ballpark would probably be about 10 grand Wow yeah having been a builder and I had all the tools I needed and I could do my own electrical and plumbing and that really helped one of the really impressive projects that you're working on right now is actually a collaboration with the city of Grand Forks where you have managed to get a tiny house community greenlit which is super exciting can you tell me about that so the city right now is very progressive and it's a place I've been waiting for for many years and so while the iron's hot I've got in there with the planners who want to do this so because we have such a high number of solar hours in Grand Forks it's a really great place to do off-grid and sustainable structures and all that and having higher density in housing who really cuts the cost down and makes it much more affordable and sustainable so all of that comes together by doing a tiny house community and small house cluster house communities so that's where we're heading so you could actually be the first legal tiny house community in Canada we might be yeah it's very exciting yeah payda this is such a beautiful home that you've built for yourself I'm so impressed with how you brought all this together into such a small space to create such a wonderful and welcoming home and I'm also incredibly impressed with the work that you're doing to actually further the tiny house movement here in Canada thank you so much for sharing everything with me Peter is such an inspiring an interesting individual I find it fascinating that he spent his entire life developing a whole range of different kinds of housing options and this is the place where he has chosen to live himself when it comes to Peters story to listen that I'll take away from this is that sometimes bliss really can be moved [Music]  you [Music],0
306,"Show me your friends and I'll show you your future. Unless you want average, in America married two point four kids with one and a half dogs But I can guarantee you you will never achieve anything greater than your highest aspiration. If you want a million you'll make a million not a $1.5 million. If you want $10 million, a $100 million and you'll never exceed that. If you change a billion lives, that's the formula to become a billionaire and change the world. Time costs lives. Show me your friends and I'll show you your future. You want to know why you're all f***** up? Just look at the bums you hang around with. I do what you don't want to do that you know that you've got to do to be where you want to be. Ted Turner just gave his 75th anniversary party on CNN a few months ago and he has, he makes a couple of comments and he says number one, and I'm not suggesting this for everybody, it's how I lived though. The first 10 years of my starting CNN, I slept on my couch, I didn't have an apartment. Bill Gates slept in the office, Steve Jobs slept in the office and I can go down a whole list. Now these are super successful mega-wealthy guys. I slept in my office, not everybody is willing to make that sacrifice. But it's not the only thing but even if you don't want to sleep in your office, if you want to send your kids to a better school, if you want to be able to take care of your mother when she gets dementia, if you want to... this all takes money. When I... my children aren't getting any of my money when I die. Not not one centavo, not one penny. And... Two of my kids are cool with it, one of them is not so cool with it. I'm not going to you know, I think Andrew Carnegie by the way, Andrew Carnegie arguably the richest most successful entrepreneur of all time. He said, the best thing that you can have for a child is him to be born into poverty. And I agree. Lack of self-esteem, lack of self-worth. Now they think they have self-worth, they think because they made a few bucks but in actuality, and when they measure it against the other 8, 10, 12 people sitting around the table they realize or they start the question ""Hell, maybe I was just lucky."" Now all of us, when you're only a one-trick guy or gal think, ""Was I lucky?"" Now I've done it so many times, I know I wasn't lucky I might have been lucky the first time but I haven't been lucky the 15, 20, 40, 50, - I know that. - Okay But maybe I was lucky the first time. My life changed when I went, I was a pretty much... a haphazard kid got in a lot of trouble, got arrested 4 or 5 times, thrown in jail and this was with my dad as a cop. But then I went, I volunteered for the draft in 1966 at the height of the Vietnam War and I went to OCS and that changed my life because it was the really first real high performance thing that I could measure myself against, with other people. Two-thirds of all Fortune 500 CEOs have one thing in common - military background. - Really Two-thirds of those two-thirds have something else Martial Arts. What do you learn in martial arts Brian? Discipline, focus. A lot of people don't believe they deserve to be there I convinced them and we have these drills, why you belong there? A lot of people that come there, you know with money that have made money think they made it by accident. I just had one of my super stars whose made a hundred million bucks tell me in the last week, ""You know, I\'m not sure I\'m going to have another lucky accident."" And I said, ""You did it."" I mean, you know, you tried a lot of things. Thomas Edison, I would, I wouldn't have done it 10,000 times. I would've hired an engineer from MIT to do it. But I mean, I've tried a lot of things nobody's failed at more things than I have and the first 100 million are successes but I could write a book about failures that'd be I mean because I've tried a lot of different things because failure is just testing and one of the reasons I've been so successful in generating this equity and value in my kids -and I call you all kids- is because I convinced them that making a mistake is okay. Your parents probably told you you can be anything you want, but you can't. That's ***. You can't. If it's all juxtaposed So but what you tell them is that you can do anything you want that you have passion for. Because that eliminates most of the crap because most people don't follow their dream, you know, like they say in the sound of music. ""You can\'t have a dream come true unless you have a dream"" Now I still dream, I dream in technicolor, I say my affirmations and goals every single night. It's bloody hard to be a high-performance person. Perfection equals paralysis. If you left it to the engineers, no car would ever come off the assembly line. No car would ever come off the assembly line and I've been in business with enough engineers that I can tell attest to that with my hand on my heart. They'd still be... Trying to make it better and the internet business is very much the same. The internet kids want to test and test and test and they will want the landing page to be this Just roll it out, the great thing about the internet is your results are instantaneous. If something that I'm overseeing at a Concorde level 60,000 feet doesn't work in two days forget about it move on. And today I had our meeting now the young kids are, ""We ran it three days sir, and we closed it down."" And they are thinking I'm going to ask why I said, ""No, that\'s fine next"" Because without them making mistakes, and without them being allowed to make the decision they never get any better and 95% of the time I know probably better than they do, We're never going to be able to know everything or have them know everything unless they make some mistakes and get comfortable with making mistakes. What gets measured gets accomplished. Without measurement you're just fooling yourself. Before I had any money I used to go to the Rolls Royce dealers and sit in the cars and smell the leather touch the leather. Okay I went to million dollar houses and my wife and I would walk through the house and they\'d say, ""When are your parents getting here kids?"" ""No, we are the buyers."" Practice within when you're without. Practice being successful. How many people listening to this today practice being successful today. Through affirmations, through going to the Rolls Royce dealer. Maybe Lamborghini, maybe something else. In my particular case it was Rolls Royce. And within a year of me going to a Rolls Royce dealer, I had a Rolls Okay Within... 19 months of me dreaming and... adding it to my goals a castle on an island, I owned Guthrie castle. - 19 months - Okay Go to stores you can't afford. Go hire lawyers, you can't afford. Lawyers will meet with anybody, accountants will meet with anybody. Go to the big four accountants. With a business idea, the first couple meetings are for free. Jettison, probably a lot of the people you hang around with. If you have poor public speaking skills join Toastmasters. Do these. If you go, if you went to a good school and you're not successful, go to the alumni deals Okay I didn't go to a good school, I'm a perfect living example that a lot of trouble as a kid, working-class background, my parents, went to just a mediocre university that I flunked out of three times before I finally graduated with honors, but... And I had no money to begin with, $820 So it's all possible But I, you know, I devoted myself to feeling successful. I was wearing suits like this, before I could afford them. Most people procrastinate because they're unsure. So just do it. And, but I've never had a problem just doing it because one of the things you learn as a young combat, infantry officer is time cost lives. We over analyze because we're unsure, we're not- over analyze, we don't over analyze because we are not sure. If it will work or not, we're more worried about on the emotional side it embarrassing us.",0
255,so this was our graph so the house that sits behind it is a three-bedroom two-bath and the city told us that it was actually legal to live in your garage as long as you permitted it the right way in Portland is actually called an ad you an accessory dwelling unit so every lot in Portland every residential lot can have a secondary dwelling unit usually in a garage sometimes in a just a separate build out back but it's all legal and when we walked in they set an ad you actually if you do it as an ad you it'll actually be free and we're like ooh freeze the perfect number for us right now  we we actually ran away and didn't we didn't want to have God we drove south in our old Volkswagen bus for about a year and a half we had saved money for what we thought would be under a half to two years we left came back and thought it was all gonna have to end  and this is usually where we end up either working or eating breakfast just to get some nice natural light and then obviously we can pull out additional two stools and sit four to six people here or if we really have to start entertaining we can actually roll this all the way out fit six adults at the end and then have a little kids table down here on the bar I wonder if we need to so we spent years before cutting the cord and leaving downsizing moving into smaller and smaller spaces purging everything saving money no we're actually mostly living in the van out front we have a lot of morning conversations like is this where we want to be today if not why are we here let's get in the van and go and so this is what we thought would be home base and will be and we consider it that because our friends and our tribe is here but we actually spend more time living in the van and allowing other people to come in and read this which then helps fund the travels when we got back from our first trip we had purged all of our furniture and so I taught myself to weld so that instead of going and buying things we could just make a few items and so these barstools were one of the first things that I I welded up and tried selling furniture for a little while until I realized that there's really no no money there for me and then once we started creating the home it just seemed like an easy transition into the cabinetry and everything that we needed in the house  literally just giant industrial casters and some steel and so you'll notice that almost everything in here is is fairly industrial modern by nature when we got back from our trip we found a community wood shop metal shop and I taught myself to weld it just kind of moved it into the cabinetry as well so instead of going to Ikea we just built solid steel frames and then came in and found a bunch of reclaimed wood to use as the doors and the panels so literally all of this is off cuts from other people's projects at the community wood shop that we work out of we just kept saving and collecting bins and bins of wood until we thought we had enough to kind of tackle the kitchen and living room and then came in and tried to lay it up in a way that was beautiful and mesh well with the steel this is actually just two by fours that are glued up in unison and you can see all the old nail holes from what they used to be which is just studs inside of old Portland homes and so in some cases we just keep those two by fours kind of uniform and use them as they are here we tried to get as much out of a Whittle as we could and so rather than using even complete two by fours that could be used for something else we just took the scrap out of the bin when people got done cutting things off on the table saw you can see how it's just glued on the inside of this points just OSB which again cheap reclaimed you know it was budget yeah I mean at the time we we literally got back from our trip we had saved money for what we thought would be a urine after two years got back and started blowing through money renting a place and things like that and then when this project came along we just decided it was better to literally put the rest of our funds into creating a roof over our head then it was to go back and live on the road for another six months and so this was just a rickety old garage garage door dark dingy and then when we got back from our travels were in Portland for a month or two we thought it's gonna be a couple of weeks we rented a place a few blocks away realized how strange it was to be in your own neighborhood while someone else lived in your house and just kind of had an epiphany one morning that our garage was going unused so the tenants were inside but nothing was in the garage so we just started the process of trying to figure out how to convert it to a home and expected that we would just pull our bus inside when we were traveling or what have you would be very simple and then the designer in me kind of took over in Portland as they were trying to support good debt Vistal are trying to support good density and so ad use right now all the systems development charges are being waived to help kind of promote the idea and opposed to you know like our neighbors there used to be tiny bungalows sitting here and so a developer bought the bungalow tore it down in order to put up two giant homes and so for us we just tried to reuse what we already had in a different way part of the code is that we have to keep parking we never seem to use it we always just park in the street but we wanted to keep it it's just nicer for our neighbors as well as for us so we kept a little bit of parking and then tried to recapture the rest as it was a two-car so this was all driveway and then we try to just recapture the rest as landscaping yard indoor outdoor space  neighbors actually thanked us they're like thanks for beautifying this terrible corner the floor is also just OSB oriented strand board so the same thing that would typically be in a lot of houses as the subfloor and then get covered over with a hard word or something else and we had actually done this inside the house as well when we renovated many many years ago put it down weren't sure what we wanted to do with the floors and we're amazed that many years later it still looked and felt great so we just did the same thing here can always come back and refinish it with something else if we want to but so far we we love the texture and the color of it so it's it's stayed thus far [Laughter] and these countertops are who media we actually poured them in place on the floor part of the beauty of having an industrial floor this kind of an upside down form some melamine which is kind of a wood with a very slick white finish on it build that into the box the shape that you want it and then put in kind of half a layer of concrete submission to make sure it's actually strong enough and then finish off with concrete let it cure for a few days and then got a few buddies over to help lift them into place you notice we seal slightly the counter top and then left this completely dry and exposed and in my preference I love just raw concrete and would use it everywhere but as a countertop kind of nice to have a bit of a sealant or a repelling nature as things spill and it works well in a garage and it's a garage you know at some level and same as these shelves I mean these are just bent pieces of steel that we drilled out and screwed into the studs so they're absurdly strong but it's literally just a sheet of Steel I mean I can't imagine a way to make a shelf any more affordably or any more beautifully we kind of just tried to work within the box that we had and we also tried to make it match our lifestyle so we still love entertaining we love having people over so it's a bit odd in a 460 480 square foot space but a third of our living space at least is kitchen and living room oddly enough even then 480 square feet this is our perfect kitchen layout and so we literally took over a very large portion of the home to ooh so wanted the Iowan range because it's better for kind of cooking and entertaining Jen's almost a master chef and so it's nice to hang out well while people are kind of able to see and interact and sitting in the stools enough storage made a wine rack literally out of scrap steel that we just welded up into a wine rack you know these function much the same way as the taller cabinets and so everything here tends to be true kitchen and then the upper cabinets become longer-term storage and then this actually becomes more guest storage and things like that so this is where we throw the umbrellas this is where you know an extra barstool when we need it lawn chairs a bunch of things when people come in if we have somebody staying there's a nice closet that's basically just dedicated to them to put their bags and things like that oddly enough we have more storage than we need we have the same rule when we lived in a Volkswagen you know if everything can be tucked away in a cabinet where it's supposed to be then it just feels tidier and more homey last  well so this set of cabinetry is multifunctional so it's basically all of our closet clothing things like that but we also needed a way to get up to the bed and so at the time we wanted the dog to be able to join us so we actually made this set of cabinetry that's basically for linens and pillows and extra things like that can actually push away and become part of the cabinets when we're entertaining and then simply pull back out so that we can kind of bound up a few stairs to get into the bed right now it's just on glides plan was to actually put casters underneath it and put some tracks like most other things our project always seems to take a backseat to everybody else's sadly the dog is now slowing down so she joins us less often than before but a couple steps were up we're comfortable and rather than having kind of a shallow loft bed where you have to be laying down it actually still gives us a space where we can hang out comfortably and you can sit up there and read read work what have you I often do both so no we really don't and that's kind of always been one of the design factors is try and put space inside of a small house where you're actually spending your time and so it seems ridiculous that we all have a you know an 8 by 12 room that's walled off and it's only used for six to eight hours a night when you're sleeping so we try to turn that on its ear a bit and have most of the space actually functional in a place where you're gonna be hanging out and using it so underneath we basically have a couple of tools we have our laundry space I mean it's really just a utility den for us to stash the things that are unattractive obviously we try to also design this in a way that in 40 years if we still need or want to be living here we can at that point the bed will probably drop down and so it'll probably be a somewhat private bedroom underneath instead of utility space not the bathroom you probably expect in a small home in most cases but I think it's the result of two people living in a van and showering outdoors for much of a year and a half and so when we got back and started creating our perfect home we tried to mimic many of the kind of outdoor spaces that we found ourselves showering and bathing in in Mexico and Central America everything here is actually coated in a in acrylic eyes kind of waterproof concrete just to make it look like an outdoor shower that we kind of hid for a year and ass a wet room which is very very kind of European in nature I mean you don't feel out here and so when we talk to a bunch of contractors about this they thought we were crazy they had no idea and so we couldn't hire any person to do it we literally had to do each stage ourselves and then we did bring somebody in to kind of travel on this stuff because I just didn't trust myself enough to do it and we ended up going with a system that's called VD or wedi born that's actually a European system that's made exactly for this so all the panels have waterproofs themselves you put them in you patch between them with waterproof stuff and then come back and do you know I mean this is basically like stucco that you put on the outside of a house and so it's not it's not like it's a material when I used to we just don't usually bring it indoors and so construction wise it was diff usage wise it's exactly what we were after so it's light it's bright it's roomy it's kind of how we work with all small spaces is rather than coming in design homes by cutting them into the boxes but to have a bathroom that's have a living room to have a bedroom and the only walls we ever build are around a bathroom so that everything else becomes more open and so that's why you see there's you know the only two walls in here around the bathroom the other walls all get you know floor-to-ceiling built-in so that there's lots of storage and then everything else can just kind of open up for flow so the doors just stained OSB as well and we had seen these really awesome barn door rollers the various companies made and charged several hundred dollars for and the last month or two we were driving the bus in Central America we actually had blown out one of our bearings and so realized that the way that the inside of a wheel works is very much like that and so just kind of put things together and you know took a simple piece of bent metal stock wrapped it around the inside of the bearing and called it a day and so what should have been a couple hundred dollars in hardware was I think fifteen dollars it's a bit of ebb and flow but if anything this place is kind of like the hotel room that we check into when we're back in town karma so we don't have to crash on a friend's couch or in their basement although that does still happen occasionally  most of our travels happened in 267 v-dub bus which was classic and beautiful and had all the kind of warm romantic feelings that you want your vehicle to have but after that drive it started to realize that it was also starting to keep us from traveling and so the more we shopped on Craigslist the more it was really apparent we didn't have enough money to buy a vehicle but our credit union was nice enough to offer us a loan with very low interest as long as it was a new car and so we tried to get him to do it for a used car and they wouldn't and so the 4x4 Sprinter was about as good as we could find out there and we thought we'd have a really tough time emotionally parting with the bus but the the comfort and the size and the ability to to stand up like modern man rather than being a hunchback really made the transition pretty easy for us so we we actually bought it as a hollow shell we came in added the windows on the sides of the vent on the top the swivel seats and then slowly started insulating and building everything in and so unlike the bus where we pretty much had to have a couch at all times that we would then open up to a bed at night everything here pretty much stays static so if we happen to pull into a campground we can rotate the seats around so we've got better kind of seating we'll eventually put a table in here to eat by but overall things in here stay as they are because there's just enough room that everything's comfortable without us having to kind of fold up a space or rearrange it at night and we have a full full-size mattress so it's real cushy yeah I mean this is actually the same mattress that we use in our house why wouldn't we be just as comfortable into that everything is built as kind of a kit of parts that can can be unscrewed so we actually didn't drill any holes into the van that weren't there by the factory so that if we ever need to pull something back down it's easy to do so without kind of destroying the cabinetry that we put in so if we ever want to wire something up again we drop a couple panels run new sets of wires and just put everything back up where it was we tried to learn the lesson from the v-dub we rebuilt the bus twice and so instead of kind of building final right away we built everything out of a cheap OSB shell and just put in boxes that were roughly the right size drove to Vancouver spent of almost a year I guess kind of summering and enjoying the van to make sure we had what we wanted and then last fall just before a winter trip came in ripped everything out and then kind of went final with everything and so we made a few changes based upon what we learned but overall most everything stuck we tried to learn from things we learned before so this is a two burner Smith cooktop it's actually the same one that we had in the bus it's a german-engineered rig we love it and it means that we kind of have countertop that can still be used the fridge is the place that in our v-dub we kind of failed we went with the cheaper fridge that we had read about that was just used in tractor-trailer trucks and seemed to be okay but in most cases those guys are always driving and so how much they pull in terms of energy off their batteries isn't an issue and so even though we were sitting on the beaches of Baja with direct Sun on our solar panels we simply couldn't keep up with the refrigerator and so this time we went more to what we already knew to be the case which is to buy sailboat things rather than automobile things because they figured this stuff out decades ago and so we had done that with most of the things but in the fridge for whatever reason we decided to save money and so now we you know went with the marine fridge that should be in a sailboat to make sure we can stay off-grid as long as we want to stay updated spices pots and pans everything in here is again welded up metal this case it's aluminum to be lighter weight and we just prefer the aesthetic because it's a little brighter in the van and then all of the panels are bamboo we had some bamboo in the bus as well and oddly enough by the end of two years of travel and living on the beach the plywood just wasn't holding up very well it's very dirty it's rotten it was horrible as where bamboo just seemed great and bomb-proof I mean it's very resilient to water it's great to work with and it also comes in any number of different thicknesses in terms of panels and so anything from thick panels that need to kind of hold their own weight to things that'll actually allow us to bend and get the type of framework that we wanted in here you know after living in the bus for a year and a half it was very clear that if you live in a small space you will spend time bent over in agony after cramming yourself into a corner and like racking your head or shin on something sharp so we kind of bowed to not have corners anymore and so this was the result it also tends to I guess look more like an airline or a sailboat we hear a lot of that but mostly it was just a not keep hitting my head on corners in the winter this is actually cabinet storage as well in the summer we actually pull out the back panel and remove the shelves so that our surfboards can come all the way up so we can put our surfboards inside this is actually our step to get into the bed and then it also folds it's basically a small marine most boats they're actually kind of hard wet it in this is one of the models that's actually just a cassette ish toilet so this whole thing pops out it's a two layer system so the seat comes off the top and then you can simply carry the vessel at the bottom and empty it into any toilet I mean you can actually do it you know in any rest stop toilet fast food toilet or ours you know when we get back home  you know and again for us it's we're actually gonna try living in our van long-term the bed is important having a nice open space is really important to us and then we also put the the fan in top so we can actually get rid of some of the hot air which is a luxury we just never had in the bus well it seems to be great I mean the only problem we've ever had is mid winter I mean this trip we actually took a winter trip and it was negative 25 degrees it's tough I mean in that type of cold environment with two humans and a dog inside of a space you're gonna collect a lot and so the only way to do it is even though you're trying to keep heat is to keep something open and keep air movement in the vehicle to try and get rid of it so if we you know we've got place for all of our bedding we've got place for comforters and pillows and sheets and things that normally you don't have a large enough space for in a van to stuff away anywhere so they end up just kind of out and exposed at all times which it just isn't how we choose to travel and then we actually end up stealth camping 80 90 percent of the time we've got a bunch of blackout blinds that we actually just built storage for into the bed and we're in stuff woods well crooked stealth mode but stealth mode nonetheless we've led the lane but because we spend so much time trying to save money and travel kind of low-key there's often not a plan so we very rarely are in campgrounds we tend to just row into a place and then figure out last-minute where we're gonna sleep and so the nice thing is if we're getting tired on the road we literally need two seconds to kind of figure out where we're gonna Park pull everything out of the storage go into kind of stealth mode and then just call it a night we do curtain up here mostly for the winter it's insulated and it rolls downs and we have a heater so not only are we only warming at the back but also nobody even knows we're in here when you've got this tight it's pretty completely blacked out yeah especially midwinter or if we're done surfing we realized we needed a place to to hang things and what makes the most sense is to be able to do it here inside so we actually just built this kind of fold flat system to be able to hang wetsuits to be able to hang winter gear and that way everything drips down into obviously kind of a front step so that it simply runs out of the vehicle again we looked high and low for the best awning and when we were in Baja we actually watched two awnings on RVs fold up over the vehicles and in a windstorm and so we went to look at marine stores and found this awning that's built for a boat to be out Wow under way and so as where most RV awnings will fold themselves up at about five miles an hour of winds this one's actually good up until hurricane force winds so 55 miles an hour you can leave the awning out so we can keep working for you rather than folding it up when you need it the most  we went to a show down in Arizona all three days the winds were gusting between 45 and 65 miles an hour and so literally everyone had to roll up their awning and putting away and got sunburns in the process and we just left ours out for the three days we were there it's not hydraulic it's actually a screw-type but there's two two actuators on the side that basically allow this to coil up inside of itself stainless steel again built for marine environment so built for way worse environments than will ever take our van to by nature and then simply coils up inside of itself when it when it folds back up definitely one of the best features we put on the VIN and then will eventually come back and put a second one out the back so that when we're trying to access our gear then we'll actually have from some protection back here as well and this is simply our garage this is our gear storage and so everything under the bed about a third of the way forward allows for the backpacking and the rock climbing the grill the barbecue and then everything over here is the volleyball / surf zone so our surfboards go in and can be stored inside and again it's important for us to not strap a lot of things to the top and the outside because we spend so much time stealth camping and so if everything's inside we simply look like a work van and so it's a lot easier for people to not assume we're on the inside and come knocking when we'd rather they don't come knocking did you guys you signed it in abstract and then you just built it or yeah we well again much like we did our garage and other spaces we design everything in 3d first and so it just seems like when you're trying to make sure you capture every square inch of a space the best way to do it is to actually start with the volume exactly as it is and figure out how to literally start carving away every square inch as you go for us it's all the way down to you know each outlet being something that can actually fold up or fold back out to plug into  cutting boards Able Seaman actually have drawer slides yeah and then over here we've got pantry space what kind of about that gist do you think you can get by design your own vehicle from Chuseok romantic locks or cost I think it's huge in both but it's also probably not fair for me to say because I'm a designer yeah and then definitely prep space somewhere and we eat a lot of vegetables so but it there's plenty of people out there that are building their own bands from scratch and so everybody has the access to do that it's just a question of ability and or confidence to do so I mean many of the things we talked about inside we had never done before either it was lots of watching YouTube and reading books to figure out how to do things and it's working I mean we've still got a ways to go we've got a lot of things we still have to finish but like everything else it's more important for us to get out and start using it rather than sit in the shop and finish it  [Music] we talked to a lot of people who want to spend more time outdoors they want to live in a van they want to do whatever that thing is but they spend so much time planning and thinking and worrying that they don't ever actually leave but I don't know that you know without just jumping and spending time you know whether it be living in a van or whether it just be living in a very small space if you're still living in a five bedroom home it's almost impossible to know what it is you want or what you need it's basically a map of our travels and most of this started as kind of tracking our trip south which was all the way down Baja Ferry Dover came across Mexico all the way down through Central America almost to Panama and then back up and around and then we're late in putting several tacks in because now it's pretty much the entire west coast to the US has been tracked over the last five years got some Southeast Asia we've got some Europe and right now we we've actually chosen to be traveling by van primarily because we want the dog to be with us and so right now most of our travel is very much limited by what we can drive to and then we don't like to talk about it but when she's no longer with us we'll start expanding the horizons again right now it feels like we could do it forever but we're certainly open to the fact that things change as we age but at least so far we're just as comfortable at living this way as we are not and it also provides the freedom to to travel and explore so why wouldn't we which is why most days we're in the band instead of here because we have we've got the ability to do it now we'd be crazy not to,0
135,in the world of muscle building supplements things can get very confusing very fast between having to sort through claims like site specific muscle growth such as building more muscles specifically on your chest and arms or other claims in which testosterone boosters promise to be as effective as steroids without any of the side effects of course it could become very difficult to sort out fact from fiction and to get the right supplements that have actually been scientifically proven to be effective and just to help you ensure that I don't have any kind of bias and that I'm not paid off by some supplement company I'm not going to be promoting any specific brand and you won't find any affiliate links in this video meaning I'm not making any money from supplement companies for sharing this information so there's no incentive for me to not tell the truth with that said let's start with a couple supplements that aren't going to be worth your money mass gainers are not going to be worth your money there's no doubt that they'll provide you with the massive amount of calories but most of those calories are going to be coming from sugar so you really have to ask yourself what is it that you're gaining muscle or body fat you're better off making your own mass gainer by taking protein powder adding one to two tablespoons of peanut butter a banana oats and whole milk and blending it all together another waste of time supplement is pretty much every testosterone supplement on the market even the best testosterone supplements are usually only going to raise your testosterone levels by twenty to forty percent maximum this is simply not high enough to notice any real changes in athletic performance while there may be some ingredients in the testosterone boosters that will help improve your libido you shouldn't expect any real muscle building benefits from such an increase next is branched chain amino acids or a b c double a's you don't need b c double a's while bulking because you'll most likely be getting all of your amino acids from the food you eat and especially if you also take a protein shake an argument can be made for the effectiveness of BCAAs during a cut but while you're in a calorie surplus trying to build muscle they're not really necessary the same goes for l-glutamine L carnitine and L arginine now the first controversial supplement that you may actually want to look into if you're planning on training in a fasted state is h mb h mb is a byproduct of the breaks out of leucine and leucine is the most powerful amino acid for muscle growth the HMV obtained from leucine can slow down protein breakdown rates and building muscle is all about decreasing protein breakdown rates while increasing protein synthesis rates however when leucine is broken down only about 5% of the leucine is turned into h mb so supplementing with more about 3 to 5 grams depending on the study has been shown to increase a number of performance markers including strength speed muscle size endurance and your rate of recovery the controversy lies in the fact that other studies have shown that H MB is not that effective so the results are mixed however there has been enough evidence for the International Society of Sports Nutrition to make a position statement on its effectiveness this is something that the ISSN rarely does unless there's a good amount of research supporting a supplement like there is with creatine for example but based on the research they recommend that you should have about 38 milligrams of H MB for each kilogram you way to experience the benefits this will work out to a daily dose of about 3 to 4 grams for most people you can divide your daily dose in half or in 3 ways and spread it out evenly throughout the day but make sure you take one of those doses preferably directly before your workout this supplement is not as necessary for those of you training in a Fed state but the anti catabolic effect that it provides makes it ideal for those of you that are training in a fasted state and want something to reduce muscle breakdown rates during your workout the last thing to keep in mind is that it may take up to two weeks of consistently taking H MB to see the full benefits now if you only have the money for just one supplement that's made to build more muscle then you're gonna want to go with creatine according to a meta-analysis published in the Journal of physiology creatine is considered the most effective natural muscle building supplement out there and this meta-analysis wasn't some small study the researchers compared the effectiveness of 250 supplements for muscle growth and they found that creatine had the most significant impact on muscle mass creatine will help give you more energy and it'll help improve your performance during your workouts especially with high intensity activities it'll also help increased strength lead to a more favorable testosterone to cortisol ratio and help you recover faster on top of that according to the center of human nutrition weightlifters that supplement seen for three months tend to gain between two to six and a half pounds of lean body mass compared to lifters that train without it the original and most studied form of creatine is creatine monohydrate but nowadays there are a ton of new creatine products to choose from there's Cree aklan and creatine HCl which is believed to dissolve better in water and can help reduce bloating and cramping and there's also creatine ethyl ester as well as creatine nitrate which are believed to absorb better than creatine monohydrate requiring smaller doses out of all of these there's no doubt that monohydrate is the most well researched proven and it's also the cheapest with that said many people swear by these other forms of creatine so you may find some unique benefits by experimenting especially if you find yourself getting bloated or an upset stomach from creatine use as far as how much to take you may choose to do a week-long loading phase where you would have 20 grams of creatine every day for five to seven days and then you would transition to only having 5 grams per day while you can do that it's not absolutely necessary if you just take 5 grams per day every day from the start instead of loading you'll still saturate your muscles with creatine it just may take a little longer some people choose to cycle creatine where they take it for six to 12 weeks and then stop for four weeks while there is no conclusive evidence in favor of cycling or not cycling if you choose to cycle you may want to do a loading phase at the beginning of each of your cycles on the other hand if you consistently take it without stopping you may want to drop to only 3 grams per day rather than a full 5 as that should be enough to keep your muscles saturated with the creatine now regardless of which creatine you get or how much you take you should know that about 20 to 30 percent of the population is considered non-responsive to creatine use which means they won't notice significant changes when taking this supplement another supplement that you may want to consider is a good pre-workout supplement an effective pre-workout supplement will help increase your strength and energy during your workouts as well as give you a better pump great pre workouts will typically contain ingredients like beta alanine which will delay the onset of fatigue and increase muscular endurance citrulline alley which can help improve blood flow increased performance improve recovery and even provide a slight boost in growth hormone during a workout and the last ingredient you'll definitely want is caffeine as this will be what's providing most of the boost in your energy levels the problem with pre workouts is that they can get a little tricky because if you take them too often you'll feel like you can't work out without the boost that they provide you'll literally feel sluggish and tired in the gym on the days that you don't take it so to avoid this and to get the maximum benefit out of a pre-workout I recommend only taking it two to three times a week on the days that you're really gonna push yourself in the gym let's move on to protein powder now even though you don't need protein powder to build muscle since you can get all the protein you need from real food protein powder can still make a couple things easier for you first of all you can take it on the go and it's not always possible to prepare a high-protein meal on the go it can also help you meet your daily protein requirements without making you feel excessively full you want to have at least point seven two point eight grams of protein for each pound of bodyweight to give you the maximum muscle building benefits and if you're cutting you may want to have a little more than that the protein will be used in a process known as protein synthesis to repair and build muscle as long as protein synthesis rates are higher than protein breakdown rates you'll have a positive nitrogen balance putting your body in a more ideal state for growth this is also why it may be a good idea to have a protein shake after your workout when you workout protein breakdown rates will rise you can slow this down and increase protein synthesis rates just by having a protein shake soon after your workout if you workout in a fasted state then having that protein shake soon or after a workout rather than later can really help with building muscle however if you have some protein before your workout you don't have to worry so much about how soon you take down that protein shake even if it's hours later when choosing the right type of protein you have a number of options including whey casein soy rice beef being egg pea and hemp just to name a few now just to make it super simple for you studies show that animal-based protein powders lead to higher protein synthesis rates when compared to plant-based sources this doesn't mean that you can't go with a plant-based protein powder like soy rice or pea as long as you have a variety of plant-based sources throughout the day you can actually achieve a more balanced amino acid profile with that said if you can have a dairy based protein powder studies show that they will typically outperform soy for muscle building purposes the two main dairy based protein powders are whey and casein whey protein has a faster digestion time allowing it to get into the bloodstream quickly on the other hand casein takes longer to digest sometimes taking up to four hours whey is better if you're having it after workout not only because of its faster absorption rate but also because it has a better amino acid profile for building muscle to be more specific it's one of the best sources of leucine which as we discussed is the most important amino acid for muscle growth now this doesn't mean that casing doesn't offer its own unique advantages that may make you want to consider getting it to taking casein before bed has been shown in studies to help increase type 2 muscle fiber size as well as overall muscle strength this may be because you'll be able to maintain a more positive protein balance while you sleep if you consume a slow digesting source of protein beforehand however if you're only looking for a post-workout supplement or you can only choose one of the two I recommend way over casing now within the category of whey protein you have concentrate and isolated while a concentrate will probably be the cheaper of the two it will also contain less protein and more carbs and fats instead besides concentrate and isolate there's also hydrolyzed whey which is believed to be even faster absorbing and more bioavailable but it's a lot more expensive given the fact that regular way is already over 96% bioavailable and there's no scientific data showing that hydrolyzed whey will absorb even faster than regular isolate I recommend saving your money and sticking with isolate if you're lactose intolerant I recommend an egg protein powder because of its high bioavailability and if you want a plant-based protein source you should get one that includes multiple plant-based sources like a mix of pee and rice to get a more balanced amino acid profile the last supplement that you may want to look into if you're in a cold climate is vitamin D and the reason is because most people don't get enough vitamin D and daily especially in cold climates your body normally gets a vitamin D from the Sun but if you don't get enough sun exposure you probably don't have optimal levels if you're deficient in vitamin D your testosterone levels will be impacted in a very negative way so if you don't get much sunshine you may want to consider adding this relatively cheap supplement into your plan that's about it guys thanks for tuning in I hope you enjoyed this video and if you have make

369,[Music]  [Music]  so this is my father's 1969 280 SL he purchased the car is the second owner actually purchased the car while my mother was in the hospital just after she gave birth to me and he drove this car every day for 10 years back and forth into the Bronx right now the car has over a hundred thousand miles but it has been sitting since 1982 for he originally purchased a 62 Impala convertible I had always wanted a convertible purchase the car took it to his office near the Bronx was stolen in a day eventually purchased another car wasn't very happy with bought this car in January of 1972 and drove it every single day back and forth to the Bronx for ten years it has been sitting like this since probably mid 1982 so it's been 37 years the first step was to clear out the old bushes and weed so we'd have clean access to pull the car out when the garage was eventually emptied based on a very quick inspection I noticed there was a ton of mouse droppings everywhere so I wanted to wear full safety gear which I think is appropriate after the years of dust and whatever else I'm sure to find as we emptied the garage out which was built in 1942 as we were clearing up the space I felt like I was going back into a time capsule from the 1960s there was bottles of rubbing alcohol on the Shelf from 67 alkyd based paint commonly referred to as oil-based enamel paint from the 70s a bottle of diazinon used as a pesticide until it was cancelled from residential use in 2004 and iran s'en butane aerosol can torch sitting next to a gallon of torch fuel so it was a miracle that the Mercedes is still in one piece now since the tires dry rodded years ago we jacked up the rear in placed wheel dollies also known as wheel skates under each tire now in hindsight I should have brought my hydraulic go jacks these are perfect for tight spaces flat tires or really low cars like on the f1 detail the front was even tighter and we couldn't get the jack there because of all the extra in the garage and the car was parked too close to the front wall so the jack wouldn't fit there either so we lifted each side one at a time at first glance though while looking for the lift points the undercarriage is in decent condition all things considering with the flat tires off the ground and on the dollies and after a quick sweeping to make sure that that momentum wasn't killed by a tiny little pebble we pulled and pushed the wheels over the garage floor hump and into the sunlight for the first time in 37 years which was pretty cool  next I opened the door and let in the first fresh air in a very long time and I will say that the interior smelled absolutely awful a mixture of mold sort of musty ish kind of smell and decaying animals it was really gross clearly much of the interior will need to be replaced but for now the goal is to clean it up enough to surprise his father when he gets home later this evening and to prepare the car for the Mercedes text in the following week as you can see the door handle was really moldy the steering wheel and the dash buttons were completely roached out but to see David's expression of the memories as a kid in the backseat and him telling us stories off-camera made this a very special detail for me  when we opened the hood I was expecting a bit more corrosion but it actually looked pretty good although I did find the source of the horrific odor more on this later opening the trunk for the first time in many years I found the original highway flares in the box Mercedes literature and maps and manuals with gorgeous engine diagrams and pop outs for repair as well as other directions or guides in German from 1969  now with all the treasure hunting done it's time to remove the mold to do this we're using lather in the aerator a scrub pad and the interior brush that was cut down to an inch for detailing like this it can be helpful to have two different length brushes to do this take my normal size interior brush and simply cut it down with scissors making it stiffer and more aggressive when appropriate when working on moldy cars always throw away your towels when you're done there's no sense in washing or reusing them so it's best to use cheap tarry towels for round two we used a 50/50 mixture of vinegar and water and increased its cleaning ability by using a steam machine all without introducing a stronger ratio of acidity  [Music]  [Music]  while Dan was working on the moldy leather I was vacuuming out the heavy dust dry flaky plastic pieces that had disintegrated years ago spider webs mouse poop and egg corns and of course I remove the mats and carpet where possible to make shampooing easier from there we scrubbed a vacuum steamed and then shampooed everything to kill or at least reduce the smell at this point in the detail we had each blown through three pairs of blue gloves so I went to the store and bought venom steal rip resistant gloves before we win any further with the job [Music]  with the mats in the Sun we moved to the steering wheel notice the color of the steam drips off the bottom of the steering wheel are very gross we also used a long or normal bristle linked brush here after cleaning up the dash a bit Dan switched back to the short hairbrush for the gearbox covered along with lather and the steam machine with the direct spray tip while Dan was working on the front I focused on the rear leather and seat belts now my goal was to kill and remove the mold but obviously I don't recommend using seat belts in this condition and age clearly all this is being replaced upon restoration but I don't want mechanic that gets sick in the process much the same idea as the Eagle Talon restoration the car was stuck in the woods for many years and was getting shipped out of the country but we needed to clean it enough so that I would not get rejected by customs but not so much that it didn't make financial sense for the owner because it would soon be ripped apart in the restoration project as well so it's the same kind of idea here with the interior in better shape we left the ozone machine in for a bit and focused on the exterior step one is kind of my favorite remove all the nests and hope nothing is still living in them as you can see we had a few tenants but their time had passed next up we used compressed air before potentially spraying water now we do this because cleaning this much debris with water only makes it a soaking wet blob of leaves and grass once the layers upon layers of poop and dust were blown off the paint we soak the car in frothy hose --less lubricant to make sure all the seals were functioning properly before power washing it this also gave the dry and brittle paint a bit of dwell time to lift as much of the baked in grime before we hit it with water while the paint was soaking we installed a swivel head nozzle to the power washer to clean the subframe from the spiders and all the dust over the many years of pulling out cars from woods and Barnes mechanics always thank us for power-washing the subframe so they don't have to reach their hands into a nest and get bitten by a spider when the car is on the lift which I would have never thought of so I always make sure to give it a good blast after our frothy test and knowing that the seals are tight we thoroughly power wash the years of dirt off the paint next step was the wheels trim and engine bonnet before quickly agitating with a wet microfiber towel and soap and a degreaser then power washed it once again  okay now at this point in the process we've cleaned the inside we've taken most of the mold off and we moved removed a lot of the mouse droppings and of course the nests and whatnot now a lot of you're gonna be asking hey what about the top here now the owner specifically asked if we could keep that top on for a couple of reasons but one being they're gonna flat bet it and take it to a restoration shop and it's gonna be an open flatbed so they don't want to take it off with fear that we're not gonna be able put it back on so that kind of makes sense so no problem we can work around that the second thing is I know a lot of you are gonna be asking hey how come you take the seats out he specifically said hey can you do me a favor leave the seats in why because his dad is gonna come home he doesn't know that we're doing this and his son David of course is doing that for his dad and he wants him to sit in the car and kind of feel the way that he felt back then etc there's more important thing sometimes than just detailing he wants his dad to kind of remember this this whole experience so at this point we've I'm using air quotes here we've washed it we really didn't wash it wash it we kind of just agitated it to get a lot of the mold and stuff off specifically so that when we polish I'm not using the microfiber pad to soak up a lot of the junk I wanted to use a microfiber pad to sort of abrade the surface and lift off all the old dead skin but not necessarily the mold and in the dirt I hope that makes sense so it's not like a traditional wash we were just kind of pounding away here just to loosen up anything in case when the Machine comes by it jiggles it out and now I have a dirty pad and now I'm scratching the paint you know etc etc so sometimes yeah I used a little judgment with respect to washing so this wasn't this was by no means the greatest wash but in terms of this car it was exactly what it needed so we're gonna dry it off take a little bit of a breath because it's super hot we're wearing these you know crazy things cuz it is really on it I can't describe the smell it's very very moldy and it doesn't like it you know like oh my god he smells so bad it just hits you in the back of the throat it makes you cough so that's that's the ones I get a little bit nervous about so we're wearing protective gear and they're gonna polish this thing out and then go back inside and of course hit it again you know we still got a lot more work doing the inside but it's it's as clean as it's ever been to restore the dry oxidized paint I first tried the Meigs microfiber pad with 210 instead of 105 or 110 as you know managing residue is going to be the main concern here and naturally it was after you buffed the paint if you can't remove the polish or wipe it clean revealing the paint underneath you as the detailer must stop and reassess what you're doing the amount of dead paint being removed is overwhelming the pad and the liquid or in other words there's more dead paint than there is polish the dead paint encapsulate the polish and it sticks to the paint so it's time to change a variable and a technique so instead I used a red foam pad 210 polish and the modown technique and it worked as expected for a step-by-step guide and specifics on how and why to perform the modown technique click the video link above on a new Ford GT to see graphics that help explain the technical aspects if you're interested now the name of the game with old oxidized paint is to develop a feel when your pad is so full of dead paint that it's time to blow it out and start all over again  the Motown process is similar in theory to a massive snowstorm that dropped two feet of snow on your driveway you don't shovel the full two feet at once you boil your back out you take off thin layers at a time so you don't overwhelm the snowblower and have it bogged down this concept is equivalent to the polish sticking or in this case bogging down to the paint to avoid the common issue take smaller fewer and shallower bites to avoid bogging down and sticking to the paint for extra pop on single stage paint we polished with a yellow loop as pad and 2/10 notice I put my suit back on here because it was getting late in the day and the mosquitoes were eating me alive [Music]  afterwards we quickly worked on the trim using a power drill polishing wheel and flits metal polish I also worked a few tight spots of the trim by hand with 2/10 and a microfiber towel well guys the car is basically done now the big thing is David's father is actually showing up coming home from work from New York City and we want to do the reveal now we have a few things left to do I have to finish up a bunch of the chrome but you can see the areas over here have really been done well we're gonna do some chrome here just finish that up I'll do the other side play with the windows of course vacuum do a few more things but more importantly David's father's 83 years old he hasn't seen the car meaning hasn't pulled out in 37 years kind of a big deal we've worked really hard dan and I most of the day here it's kind of the moment of truth so I'm gonna pull the camera back there Davis file is gonna be coming from that direction and I think all of our hard work is going to be worth the effort once we see his face so I'm pretty excited so I'm gonna go hide in the corner and then wait for him to come out  David you want to go to your dad  [Music]  there you go  good like to hear that  [Music]  after seeing the car cleaned up he agreed with the Sun it's time to fully restore the family car and pass it down to his grandchildren  as long as I can  I was born in 81  [Applause]  [Music]  [Music] and as luck would have it naturally after all that work it started to thunder so we needed to pull it back inside quickly before it gets pulled back out again next week on its way to the restoration shop  [Music] Oh guys we did it mission accomplished David is actually taking the car in and getting it restored so hopefully I have some footage of that the next couple of months or years now again my mission with this video and with this job because it wasn't real job is to restore the car and kind of just motivate his dad to be like oh my gosh I remember what this looked like let's go in and kind of restore it and pass it down to the family so very cool a quick note of thanks to David a lot of times I don't get to fill me so every time I post a video I usually have five or six or seven videos that I can't post meaning you know for one reason or another the family doesn't want that on there and I can respect that in this case David did so thank you because we got to shoot a really cool video and it was a fun experience and sort of be there when his dad experienced that was certainly you know emotional off-camera and that kind of thing so thank you for allowing us to share this so if you guys liked this kind of video please subscribe and make sure you check out the Eagle Talon video where I pulled it out of the woods absolutely discussing the same kind of idea so if you dig this video I'm sure you'll like that one as always guys thanks for watching I'll see you next time [Music]  [Music],0
46,this segment will demonstrate the successful methods strategies and technologies used to remove 40 feral hogs from a single location over three and a half months we will discuss each step in detail to reinforce the ability to perform 100% capture results in less than perfect conditions this was one of our most difficult and frustrating hog removal projects to date as a Sanders had been educated by three different sources first there was a high population of dog hunters in the area which pressured hogs every weekend and changed their feeding and movement patterns second gun hunters only shot adult sales at automatic feeders which made the rest of the sounder negatively associated bait sites to danger areas lastly the landscape was littered with these 5 by 10 portable traps which only captured a few juveniles but educated the adults to avoid future of metal contraptions the first step of our capture success matrix is to condition hogs to trust a daily food source we erected this feeder on 10 January to begin collecting Intel and documented very odd behavior during the next six weeks there were six different Sounders using the bait site but they only visited the area once ever seven to nine days one week we counted 25 hogs to the next it was only 19 total we counted 40 different pigs from six separate Sounders we shot these three motherless pigs as they were isolated by themselves at a midday food plot two hundred yards from the bait site we erected our standard 35 foot diameter enclosure between two heavily used trails to mine gates were placed at opposite ends of the trap to allow two separate entrances and exits hopefully this strategy would overcome the PhD education and trap avoidance these hogs had previously learned notice we carefully camouflaged both gate entrances and T posts with pine trees and branches we timed and tested our camera transmitter to both gate receivers for simultaneous discharge then hand mated with soured corn to begin step two of our capture success matrix we knew conditioning hogs to trust the Corral enclosure as a daily food source would be more difficult as a Sounders only visited the bait area one day per week and already associated feeders and traps to danger the first sounder visit to the enclosure took place on 28 February at 1855 these 19 juveniles entered both gates of the enclosure and nervously fed for approximately 40 minutes before quietly leaving the second visit to the enclosure took place on March 2nd at 1916 these juveniles were from the 19th Pig sounder and the 6th Pig sounder at 22 14 they spooked for no apparent reason and quickly departed the trap notice a few pigs from the new sounder become confused about the exit locations this negative experience will sometimes make pigs more apprehensive to enter the enclosure next time these 15 pigs are from a completely different sounder they enter the enclosure on March 3rd at 1823 notice the black boar in the background completely avoiding the trap March 2nd and 3rd was a Saturday and a Sunday watch their nervous behavior and listen to their vocalizations as they enter the enclosure on the following Friday night March 8 at 2104 this behavior was becoming very frustrating for our team we had good intel on their numbers with 37 pigs from six different Sounders and four different adults out but only juveniles were using the bait site one day per week and usually on the weekend the only logical conclusion was these hogs were pressured by dog or gun hunters from another location and only showed up to our location on the weekends we decided to drop the gates the next time we had 25 or more hogs inside the enclosure using this Intel these hogs show up one week later on Friday night 15 March at 1931 here is footage of sound number two refusing to enter the enclosure yet again this camera has been at the enclosure for over two weeks and she acts as if this is the first time she notices it we distinguish each sounder by uniquely marked pigs notice the white Poland China gilt between the feeder legs at 1937 last week was the first time her sounder entered the enclosure finally at 1954 the white Poland China exits and sound number one has entered the enclosure for the first time she is the red hand standing at the top of the screen between the feeder legs with a white belt across her shoulders we believe there are now 31 pigs inside the enclosure and we are waiting on the last three juveniles Tanner the white pole in China or sound number 2 delivered an alert runt from outside the enclosure and eliminated our best trapping opportunity to date only a fraction of the pigs returned to feed for another 10 minutes and were incredibly nervous the entire time here is a rare look at sound number 3 at 1959 she never entered the enclosure during the entire month of trapping operations the sounder exits the enclosure leaving bait on the ground the next trapping opportunity took place nine days later on Sunday night 24 March at 22:14 notice how incredibly nervous the sounder appears this was only the sixth time pigs had been at this location during the past four weeks farmers had already begun planting corn and we knew trapping chances would diminish in future weeks we changed our mission focus to capture as many of the remaining 37 hogs as possible in the trap enclosure and then shoot the rest during thermal operations at night the group returns two minutes later at 22:16 and cautiously enters the gate threshold we currently have 21 pigs feeding inside the enclosure and seven more still outside two minutes later at 22 18 these four pigs enter while three remain outside we observe the bait site for an additional six minutes calculating our odds at capturing the entire sounder the past months Intel of nervous behavior from surrounding hunting and trapping pressures combined with lessons learned from last week's missed opportunity along with increased corn planting acreage told us the smartest decision was to capture this group and attempt to shoot the remaining 12 during thermal operations at 20 to 24 we simultaneously dropped coal mine gates to capture 25 pigs  [Applause]  this is one of the few times our team did not immediately kill pigs inside the enclosure because we knew it would be impossible to trap the remaining 12 leaving pigs inside a trap overnight destroys the opportunity to capture another sounder for two reasons first even domestic pigs are intelligent enough not to urinate or defecate where they eat or sleep their bathroom area is always located outside their feeding and bedding areas second leaving pigs inside a trap overnight allows them to communicate distress to others in the area many of our subscribers have asked to hear these vocalizations here was a perfect opportunity to deliver these sounds  we killed these 25 inside the enclosure on the morning of 25 March within shot the remaining 12 at an adjacent location a few weeks later during thermal operations at night combined with a three Juvenal shot in February we still achieved 100% success by removing 40 of 40 hogs in the area we needed to demonstrate the integrated pest management approach by using multiple methods and technologies when traditional hunting and trapping pressures from surrounding locations produced erratic behavior and trap avoidance high volume feral hog control is more art than science the next video in our series will continue to demonstrate feral hog behavior so viewers will better understand how to accomplish 100% captures for more effective hull

447,hey what's up guys chat here with green  lights shooting and welcome to this new  video so today we were talking about  which Glock is right for you a lot of  people have narrowed down what handgun  they want to the fact that they want a  Glock but then there are so many  different Glocks I don't know what you  want to choose so that's where we're  here that's why we're here today before  we get into that I do want to mention I  am at TNT guns and range in Murray Utah  this range is absolutely off the charts  fantastic facility staff selection  everything here I can't speak highly  enough about thanks to them to making  this video possible give them some love  their website is that in the video  description below next thing I want to  mention is that I'm rocking that give  rise tactical t-shirt if you like this  look you like the style very slim fit  very long booth concealed carry make  sure to grab yourself one over NGLs  gear.com now let's get into the Glocks  so as I mentioned you you narrowed it  down you know you want a Glock you're  just not sure which Glock you want now  obviously you know you first of all you  want to figure out which caliber you're  looking at so generally speaking we'll  stick with that 9 40 or 45 there's also  380 if you know you want to be sort of  in that concealed carry really small  option for the sake of this video we're  gonna go with 9 I'm going to show you  all the different options in 9 and then  you can carry those across pretty much  to 40 and 45 depending on just which  size of gun you want you can find pretty  much all these sizes in each caliber but  9 is a fantastic option if you're  looking at something that's easy to  shoot at the range that you know will  help pack enough punch for concealed  carry you can have a good peace of mind  about it it'll also carry a lot of  rounds so you can hopefully get a lot on  target as well as you know you know home  defense whatever it is you want 9 is a  great kind of medium 40s gonna give you  a little bit more you know the rounds  are a little bit hotter a little bit  bigger bullet stuff like that and then a  45 you've got a real big round it's  moving a little bit slower a little bit  less capacity but it is a real big round  ok so anyways we're gonna stick with 9  millimeters here in front of me in terms  of size I've got from smallest to  biggest an we're gonna work our way up  through those so let's start with this  guy this is the Glock 43 this is the  smallest of the bunch of 9-millimeter so  this one the biggest thing is it's a  single stack you're gonna notice that  the width is a lot smaller than the rest  of them and that is  because the magazine is a not-so  staggered that it's going that it's  making that that magazine wider which is  making the gun wider so this Glock is  meant for concealed carry you know the  the slim nature of it makes it easy to  conceal against your waist whatever it  is the barrel length is coming in at  three point four inches so it's the  smallest barrel out of the bunch and  it's weighing only 16 ounces so that is  really light it's got all the same  standard functions you know you've got  your big magazine release here this  magazine is holding six rounds so if  you've got one in the chamber you can  have a total of seven rounds on you you  know same trigger same drop safety  everything safety wise is internally  we're not going to talk about what makes  clocks clocks because you're already  here biggest thing to remember about the  43 is that single stack it's small it's  light it's meant for concealed carry  so concealed carry is really your only  thing you're worried about 43 is a  fantastic option for that next up we're  gonna step up to the Glock 26 now this  one again is meant for that concealed  carry option the big difference though  is that we have a double stack so the  rounds are staggered here allowing you  to carry a little more this one carries  10 rounds so you're getting four extra  rounds in the magazine here as well as  if you want one in the chamber you're  looking at 11 rounds which is awesome  for a concealed carry gun it is gonna be  a little bit thicker a little bit  heavier but still very very concealable  this barrel is still at 3.4 inches  but we're at 22 ounces now so we're  definitely going up in weight a little  bit but yeah so I'd still say this one's  primarily concealed carry it's not the  most fun to shoot at the range you know  it's got that short little you know you  kind of missing your pinkie there on the  grip so it goes underneath there there  are some grip extension if you want to  get your pinkie on there otherwise just  tuck that bad boy under wrap your hands  and it's not too bad to shoot but it's  not super fun to shoot at the range so  this is definitely definitely a  concealed carry centric gun next up in  the lineup we have the Glock 19 this is  your compact size so this is right in  the middle it's a fantastic sort of  compromise between all the sides it's  got a long enough barrel barrel length  here is four inches so it gives you a  little bit more stability at the range  stuff like that but the biggest  difference is that you can now get your  entire hand on there your pinkie has a  spot to go so it's still an easy gun to  shoot at the range you can shoot this  all day and it's not  kill your hands it's not gonna be  awkward to hold but it's still small  enough to concealed-carry you're also  getting five more rounds so this  magazine is gonna hold 15 rounds so  obviously great for concealed carry  obviously great at the range so you're  not reloading all the time wait why is  your at 24 ounces here so you're only  adding two ounces from that Glock 26 and  you're getting that pinky on there so  this is personally my choice for  concealed if I'm going with this with a  26 I do like the 43 for complete you  know easy summer carry or something like  that but if I can wear a jacket I can  wear a hoodie or something to conceal a  little bit easier I'm going with the 19  over the 26 it's easier to shoot the  range and it's it's not too much harder  to conceal next up we have the full-size  so this is the Glock 17 we're getting a  full four and a half inch barrel here  this thing is designed a little bit more  for range shooting you can see the grip  is a little bit longer here you can  easily get your whole hand on here  depending on your back straps you know  if you have big hands if you have small  hands it'll come it'll accommodate it'll  accommodate any size hand very very well  it's easy to shoot it's smooth to shoot  the longer barrel the bigger grip just  makes it so that you can be a little  more accurate time after time consistent  with it yeah it's definitely meant for  range I personally wouldn't conceal  carry it out of the magazine here you're  getting 17 rounds so you're only getting  two more rounds out of that 19 and that  extra length on the barrel and on the  grip makes it that much harder to  conceal so I personally wouldn't get  this one for concealed carry you know if  you're a bigger frame you want a little  bit bigger gun it's not impossible it's  just not what I'd recommend for  concealed carry this is definitely a  range gun I want to practice with want  to feel good with one two that's easy to  shoot right and last but not least in  the lineup we have the big boy this is  the Glock 34 so this is sort of the  match style gun out of the group this  one has a 5.3 inch barrel and it's  weighing in at 26 ounces I don't think I  mentioned by the way this one is 25  ounces so you're really only adding an  ounce from the 19 this one comes in at  26 ounces so you're just adding one more  ounce on there but you can see it's got  finger grooves here this thing easily  once again full size grip fits any size  hand very well the 5.3 inch barrel  makes this thing a breeze to shoot very  very low recoil high accuracy consistent  shooting gun you've also got a little  bit of a ported slide here to make it a  little bit lighter yeah it's a it's a  good gun this one is definitely  definitely made for that range time if  you're a competition shooter it's  obviously great for that but it's not  really concealed carry gun it's  something that would work fine for I  guess home defense and stuff like that  but this thing has definitely made for  range time if you demand that you know  high consistency accurate shots low  recoil this is definitely the way to go  I enjoy shooting the 34 probably the  most out of any of this lineup just  because it's so fun and accurate and  just awesome to shoot but it's a  nightmare to concealed carry it's 5.3  inches on the barrel it's just not meant  as a concealed carry gun if you're  looking for a range gun that's just a  blast to shoot that's competitive to  shoot and you demand a really good  shooting gun the 34 is fantastic for  that once again 17 full size option 19  is kind of your mid-sized kind of does  it all option 26 if you're looking for a  concealed carry kind of only option I  was a little more capacity and then the  43 here if you want that single stack  that easy super easy to carry slim style  but you're only carrying six rounds once  again that's the lineup for the 9  millimeters if you want those in 40 or  45 most of these sizes are available  just hit up Glocks website and you can  learn more about what size that carries  over to but that should give you kind of  a basic idea of what Glock should fit  what you're looking for anyways  that's all I got for e I hope this video  was helpful was insightful and yeah if  you have any questions leave them down  in the comments below if you enjoyed it  get that thumbs up button I will see you  next time on green light shooting thanks  so much for watching,0
209,"welcome back everybody this is Eric from all spawn and gun I have a very special guest at my range today in case you don't know this is Jerry Mitchell act he came out to talk to us today we're gonna be talking a little bit about intermediate handgun marksmanship basically transitions drawing sight picture trigger control ways to improve speed we could not have a better instructor out here with us today so Jerry won't you take over here and give us an idea what we want to talk about what we're going to work on guys is basic coming out of the host to making the first shot what you trying to do here how to make that consistent what I'm running is my mep open pistol it's the pro series so as an open gun I can do anything I want to it I run a tactical light to add a little bit of weight to it okay and it's magnified it actually quite afford it it has a vortex of raising red dot on it has a magazine well has a tungsten guide rod 26 round magazine so it's an open division gun I can do what I want to it and you can get away with it it fits into the into that package really nice so what I like about them and peas guys it's actually a very functional gun you can change the back straps it comes with three different back straps sure so it fits just about any hand size just so you guys know you know Jerry's talking about his MMP here this is the standard MMP pro series and this is what his gun essentially started life as now his gun does have an aura more cut and that's how you got your optic on there right there right this is the MP Pro Series it's that core model which means it's fit for optics already comes with five a different adapter base it'll take seven different sites available ok aftermarket red dot sights and it also Co witness on five of the the red dot sight so do you want to have a package where you can have either or a table that's just actually going to get guys it's right it's ready to play right out of the box so it's been a great gun oh he's gone alright well let's say let's have a look once you got going on here grab some ears what you want to remember when you're when you draw your pistol out of a holster you wanted to come right up on under your dominant eye you don't want to have to tilt your head or lean or bend your knees so if I'm standing there looking at the target all I want to do is draw the fist through and bring it right into this into the target zone all I want to do is move my hands and bring it right under my dominant eye and a good way to calibrate where you are as a shooter is we do a drill called the bill drill which you come out of the holster and six rounds on one target it counted what what you're doing with this drill it teaches you rapid-fire but it also teaches you how to lock your wrist in the elbows so every time you fire an accurate shot no matter what platform you would have in your hands it's going to return right back to the center of the target if it's not returning right back to the center of the target net holding right so it kind of calibrates you to the platform that you have being a shotgun rifle or pistol so working with a pistol what I'm looking to do here just come out of the holster shoot the target in the middle of six times for a nice little tidy group and see how long that takes all right it's a good way to start go ahead and load her up here good to go good to go eyes and ears guys here we go  holy smokes so just come out of the host to keep it under your dominant eye first jobs are 1:13 what's smoking but it's an average out of a tactical host and not a bad draw so when you go back and review your shots plates we had 17 to 15 a 13 to 16 and 15 and a 15 so we run in six rounds see a total time was so we shot six rounds on target pretty much about eight tenths of a second you know we're not too much work so you saw they're pretty pretty tidy so what I'm without the ultimate expression of that would be to go ahead and do that same performance but two on each of three targets in the same amount of time just as fast as you just did it but in all three torso we had a 189 so let's see if we can run across and do the same drill I got to see this  Wow  well that was blindingly fast so we're right back there again guys so what you saw was the same the same performance but on multiple targets and the only thing I did there was use my time wisely in between shots vision wise and you see it came right across had good hits first targets pretty good oh yeah so what you have to remember there guys good technique is a foundation of all your shooting if you watch I'm gonna stand right here to the side if you watch there if you watch the muzzle of the gun what I'm what I'm trying to do here when I shoot rapid fire is not let the platform jump at all the least amount of this dirt of dispersion you have on the muzzle it's going to amplify greatly a distance so what I want to do is have a technique to when I hold that pistol it doesn't matter what caliber good right here yeah all right you watch if you watch the MOT you watch my muzzle here I'll go ahead and shoot it you didn't see a lot of flip right there I'm just not letting it jump we've got 13 12 another 13 so we're under about 1,300 splits per shot and keeping them on the target pretty easy so what you have to realize good technique is the foundation of all your shooting so if the gun is not consistently coming back to where you're looking and to a site picture you need to tweak and get it back in line hold it with that show them show them how you grip a pistol like you're your grip on the pistol we still get a close-up of that okay you know I think that that's where a lot of people fall short at least in my bit of experience with it is that you really have to have a good purchase on the gun and I'd like for people to be able to see how Jerry actually holds a pistol well the main thing guys has to line up with your dominant eye so when I grab it you also realize that this thing wants to fly out of your hand so the idea of shooting position on any handgun was to have the boar in line with the centerline of your hand then they could only know like pointing then it would only recoil straight back but the way it's designed of course the barrel sits over the hand so if you give it leverage point that's more leverage point where the room say so what you have to do as a shooter is try to get as high on that gun pistol revolver so when you fire it it's going to try to recall straight back so you notice the web of my hand as it as high as possible on the back of the pistol high as you can get it okay all right the thumbs I don't actually do anything with my thumbs they're just end a way so I just let them get some air that's usually what I do to know what happened we try to drive with your thumbs a lot of things can happen especially when you do reloads and working really fast out of the holster so I'll just kind of get them out of the way so with my non firing hand the other thing you want to remember is your your wrist position is going to be critical on how well you can control recoil the more straight up and down there the harder it is the more muscle lock it takes so if it's broken over Center like this it's a lot easier so basically you support hand you just lay it in there you want to try to get as much contact as you can when that grip panel and bring it on out to the target and make the shot well a lot of folks have trouble is actually try to drive the handgun with the trigger finger this job is only to fire a shot and reset the trigger so if you try to do anything else with it it burns the clock and you're not gonna have a fast second shot all right give us an example of that like how would how would someone okay well what I was doing there was as soon as I fire a shot I'm letting up so when I'm coming into the second target I'm gonna on the trigger hard enough to where as soon as it gets in the center it's gonna cook off another shot okay if I do if I do anything different I'm gonna be behind the curve sure so the idea of firing a shot is when you start shooting a handgun the noise and the and the the recoil effect makes the average person want to drive with their trigger finger well they wanted they wanted gern they want to hold it and let it come back down on target didn't release what you should do as soon as you fire the shot and it's coming back into the target zone you should be coming back with your trigger finger should release it during the recoil cycle and pick it back up come back in there and make it hot now standing is that simple what is that hard but what you once you figure out the pull and release you can actually cook them off pretty good I've got my open division magazine of course it's a limited to one hundred and seventeen millimeters so this package hose 26 rounds pretty comfortably so I'm going ahead go ahead and top that Smith & Wesson off come out of the host and put see if I put 26 on the target there see how long that takes all right target in the middle all of that only one miss that's amazing yeah I got to uh I got to looking over the gun there whew and done that in a while that was wicked fast actually picked up 27 so I must have had 27 in that mag after the springs take a set they'll actually hold a boarding that they started with so it's a 4.5 and the first shot was a 102 so 4vets at three three-and-a-half seconds put those rounds on target 27 rounds on target so it's kind of fun that's wicked fast but what I'm looking for when I was actually doing that performance was trying to drive it between the edges of the target you see how the other group was straight up and down now just kind of letting it bounce and just not over overworking it just riding the trick I try to get you know what it is it's almost like you know in my experience shooting machine guns you know if you're behind a belt-fed machine gun you're letting the cadence of the gun sort of take over and then you're reacting that cadence you're just letting the gun do what it needs to do and you're controlling what the guns doing I shoot machine guns excellent but in your case your hand is kind of a machine gun so you're kind of like you know just letting it give you an idea what we did there was an 18 11 to 12 a 15 13 so I start to get back in cycle 12 of 12 it said 17 13 11 14 it's at eleven fourteen eleven that's a pretty hot splits in there 13 this gun shoots so easy that I have a tendency to work it too hard so as I was shooting I had to I was in and out of how hard I was holding it to make this happen I haven't shot at rapid fire in a while so it actually takes a little bit different technique to that just make them burn sure if you if you over muscle it it you you want to drive with your trigger finger so there's that there's a fine line between control and and rate of fire so and that's an amazing display of pistol marksmanship I tell you what I don't know if I want to try after that let's hang them up and give you a rush yeah absolutely I'd love to try it with that crazy race gonna be awesome yeah awesome all right I'm going to try the same exercise that Jerry just did I'm probably gonna do it about double the time that's okay I've got one of these amazing 26 round magazines which I'm gonna have to get a couple of these bases these things are just awesome and they work that's the beauty of it so I'm actually not wearing a holster I'm just going to kind of I guess leave the gun kind of low and ready that way we're keeping it in a safe direction let's try this thing out so I was three to half seconds for 27 rounds let's see if you can do it yeah I don't know about that whatever you ready shooter ready right I'm bi very nice that was a five point seven for use for your time on target 27 rounds so about double the you're actually shooting pretty good okay yeah modes of control was excellent just got to work on the speed the trigger release is killing you because I'm basically what I'm doing is I'm I'm probably moving too much with my foot trigger finger might be I'll tell you what guys this core MMP is just an awesome pistol especially the way Jerry has it set up here it's all in a gun it's not me no it's you I promise you all right we're gonna try again same target all right alright you ready to do it yes shooter ready stand by  not bad he had a couple of them fly away from me but yeah bad that was actually a five point four or five not the same as for the first to the last shot yeah yeah cool what am I doing wrong my trigger finger excited let me see if I can excite my finger one more time all right you got a second yeah absolutely go right ahead I hate to load a magazine you know what I found about ammo when you open a box like that and once the air hits it it goes bad got about a 30 30 minutes shelf life so yo open a box ammo guys you got to hurry up and get it downrange go right ahead it's fast try that you'd hate to see it spoil they shoot the target on the left let me see if I can crank it up a notch oh I'm thinking give me another mag you shyster you're just trying to die I'm thinking now instead of shooting all right holy smokes did you imagine somebody rob robbing a liquor store while Jerry's in there buying a beer or something and you know he just happens to be you know coming back from a match or something and then unleashes out on somebody that's like an mp5 Oh mo how fast was that oh by the way Bob running by myself by my first run oh wow yeah but not as fast I used to be so anyways being modest it's just fun gun fun gun absolutely yeah I tell you that the trigger on that thing is just beautiful and I think that what I tend to do when I'm trying to shoot fast and you can probably mirror this this concept when I try to shoot fast like when I'm running in saiga-12 or something I've outrun saiga-12 before very rarely but like like we were testing ourselves on the s12 the other day and I was dumping like ten shots in two seconds which in theory you think okay yeah that's fast but it's not really when you think about when you look at the slow-mo and you see yeah the technique that's being applied in the fact that there's so much movement there if I'm actually fully releasing weezing again like you said it's like that it's like that anticipation like the recoil forces are almost causing you to break your concentration off a proper trigger discipline and their discipline is hard to maintain in a recoil cycle where you're really watching everything that's going on in and trying to pay attention it's fun to shoot it is fun to shoot it's fun to shoot but I realize that now after watching you shoot and seeing the techniques that you employ and like that just really good trigger discipline I was watching you while you're shooting and and just the way that I mean like you're literally just you're just really like kind of riding that area between the sear and the brake it's just that it's a small amount where you just you found that sweet spot that you got to minimize the motion on the trigger exactly cuz that kills time that's what's taking so long yep minimize motion always faster than the other guy less work is always better that's right yeah it makes them so less you have to measure work delay the least same thing on a draw yeah if you cut out all the stuff that doesn't contribute their performance and just use what it has to what you have to do to get a gun out the hosters gonna look a lot better no doubt more consistent no doubt well um so what would you say to somebody I mean if they were really wanting to let's just say not even get into competition but just say someone wanted to become a better pistol marksman they wanted to really take the time to learn just how to defend their families better how to protect their families in their home or how to how to just be a more efficient plinker even just the home hobbyist basic pistol marksman what would be like the best amount of if I see would give to someone like that to get better well you have to start with accuracy first being able to hit a target consistently and I liked well we train we shoot night matches now so we do like we do low-light and we do highlight we do stressful shooting and competition so the idea is when you're shooting well and you and everything is in your favor well that's that's one thing but when you go to competitions you out of your favor of you or you in situations where you're you're nervous you don't really know the course of fire it's a stressful environment and what that does to you it makes you a better person a better gun handler and that's what you're trying to do when you when you compete and not necessarily that you win the match or you lose the match is that - or that you were better that you're a better competitor you take something from it you know you take something from that competition that makes you a better shooter moving forward and you just take all of those experiences and they compound and they compound and then they integrate into your training exactly and then one day you're you know you were there so what you want to look at yourself more as a gun handler than a shooter like I tell people that take concealed carry class if you if you bought a violin and put it in the trunk of your car and you're driving along the highway and you're and you're passing a violin concert you're gonna go up on the stage and be a violin concert no no you're not gonna be I cannot go better do that so same thing with that handgun if you're gonna buy a gun for self-defense and you never go in a in a situation that puts you off level of what you're comfortable with sure non petition or whatever night training you're never going to you're never gonna have that next level you know you're always going to default you're never gonna increase every stress cause this yourself you have to default to learn so when I when I go out and do drills I always try to leave with something that I can't do I stress myself there then I'll do something that I can do and I get a good feeling they go back to the house and try to figure out why I didn't do this right and I come back and to practice again well guys pay attention as Gerry knows what he's talking about I've been really lucky to have you here with me today I know we're here over the last couple of days Jerry and I have been filming a lot the farm here it's been a lot of fun and I've been really honored and privileged to have a guy like Jerry here because he just got so much experience in the gun world and he's so well-respected and it means a lot to me to have him here to be able to share his knowledge with you guys and if you guys up to this point if you don't know who Jerry was or don't know who he is you should now obviously but subscribe to his channel check out his videos he's really wanting to do the YouTube stuff allotting and get more of the YouTube videos out there so they're really putting together some awesome content and you should really check him out and Jerry I appreciate you coming over thank you my pleasure to be here thank you sir thank you we'll see you next time [Music] you",0
267,"So this story begins: I was at a friend’s house She had on the library shelf a copy of the DSM manual Which is the diagnostic and statistical guide for mental illness. And it contains every mental illness that exists. In the past, in the 1950s, it was a small, thin booklet. Then it got bigger and bigger and bigger, Now it is a 886-page directory. It currently contains 374 mental illnesses. While I was reading it, I was wondering if you had any mental illness, It turns out that I have twelve of them. (Laughter) I have generalized anxiety disorder, This is necessarily known. I have nightmares disorder, Which is put under classification If you have frequent dreams that you will be pursued or declared to be a failure-- And all my dreams include people chasing me on the street Shouting ""You are a failure"" (Laughter) I have problems with the relationship between parents and the son, Which I blame my father for. (Laughter) I'm joking. I'm not kidding. I'm joking. And I have the disease. And I think it is a rare fact Have disease disease and generalized anxiety disorder, Because disease disease makes me feel very anxious. Whatever it was, I was looking through this book, Wondering if I was more crazy than I expected. Or maybe it is not a good idea to diagnose that you have any mental illness If you are not a trainer to work professionally in this field, Or maybe the psychiatrist profession has a strange desire To label what is considered normal human behavior as a psychological disorder. I didn't know which of these two things is correct, But I thought it was a rather interesting idea. And I thought maybe I was supposed to meet a psychiatric critic To get his point. So I ended up at the lunch table with one of the Scientologists. He is a man named Brian He runs a special operations team of Scientologists Determined to fight psychiatry, wherever it is. They call the CCHR So I told him, ""Can you prove it to me Psychiatry is a false science that cannot be trusted? "" He said: ""Yes, we can prove it to you."" I said, ""How?"" He said: ""We will introduce you to Tony."" I said, ""Who is Tony?"" He said: ""Tony is on Broadmoor."" Now, what he means by Broadmoor is Broadmoor Hospital. It was known as the ""Broadmoor Sanctuary for Unreasonable Criminals"". There they send serial killers And people who are unable to help themselves. Then I said to Brian, ""What did Tony do?"" He said, ""Hardly anything. Hitting someone or something like that, Then he decided to claim madness to get out of prison. But he claimed madness very well, and now he's stuck in Broadmoor No one can believe that he is sane. Would you like us to try and get you to Broadmoor to meet Tony? "" And then I said, ""Yes, please."" So I took the train to Broadmoor I began to yawn irresistibly at Kempton Park, Apparently, this is what dogs do when they're anxious-- Irresistibly yawning. And we got to Broadmoor. I was taken through a gate followed by a gate followed by a gate followed by a gate To the recovery center Where you can meet patients. It looks like a giant hampton The whole place has peach and pine trees and its colors are comfortable. The only glaring colors are the red color of the emergency button. Patients began to move in. They were a little full and wore cotton sports shorts And they seem easy to comply. Brian whispered Scientology to me, ""They are under the influence of medicine,"" Which is considered to be the worst thing that could happen in the world. But what I thought was probably a good idea. (Laughter) Then Brian said: ""Here's Tony."" There was a man walking inside. He did not look fat, his body looked very good. He was not wearing these cotton sports pants, He was wearing a striped suit. His arm was outstretched Like a man exited from ""The Apprentice"" He looked like a man wanting to dress up Convince me that he is very sane. Sat down. I said ""So, is it true that you occupied to reach here?"" He said: ""Yes, yes. Of course. I hit someone when I was seventeen. I was in prison awaiting trial, My cellmate told me, Do you know what to do? Call madness. Tell them you're crazy. They will send you to any of the many hospitals. Where the nurses will bring you some pizza. You will own your PlayStation. "" So I said, ""Well, how did you do that?"" He said, ""I asked to see a prison psychiatrist. And you've watched a movie called ""Crash"" Where people get sexual pleasure by bumping cars into walls. So I said to the psychiatrist, ""I get sexual pleasure from bumping cars into walls."" So I said, ""And what else?"" He said, ""Oh, yes. I told the psychiatrist I want to see women die Because it makes me feel normal. ” So I said, ""Where did you get that from?"" He said, ""Oh, from Ted Pandey's autobiography That they had in the prison library. "" In any case, he claimed the disease very well as he put it They did not send him to Wathira Hospital. They sent him to Broadmoor. And the moment he got to this place, He said he took one look at the place, asked to see a psychiatrist, He said: ""There has been a terrible misunderstanding. I am not mentally ill. "" I said, ""How long have you been here?"" He said, ""Well, if I had implemented the sentence I was sentenced to imprisonment for my original crime, I would have taken five years. I've been to Broadmoor for 12 years. "" Tony said it is very difficult to convince people that you are sane To convince them that you are crazy. He said: ""I thought it was the best way to look natural You may be by talking to people naturally about natural topics Like football or what is shown on TV. I am subscribed to ""New Scientist"", And recently it had an article How the American army was training hummingbirds to smell explosives. So I said to one of the nurses, ""Do you know that the US Army trains hummingbirds? To sniff out explosives? "" When I read the medical notes written about me, I found that they wrote: ""It is believed that bees can sniff out explosives."" He said, ""You know, they are always looking for Non-verbal signs of my mental condition. But how do you sit sane? How to put a leg on the other in a rational way? It is impossible. "" And when Tony said that to me, I thought, ""Am I sitting like a journalist? Should I put one leg over another like a journalist? "" He said, ""You know, on the one hand, I have the tendencies of a serial killer like Stockwell Strangler The ""Tiptoe Through the Tulips"" usurper is on the other side. So I tend to sit in my room a lot because I find them terrifying. They consider sitting for a long time in the room as a sign of madness. They say that this proves that I am lonely and arrogant. "" So, only in Bordmore, the unwillingness to go out and walk around with the serial killers It is a sign of madness. Anyway, it seemed completely normal to me. However, what do I know? When I got home, I sent an email to his doctor, Anthony Madden. I said, ""What is the story?"" He said: ""Yes. We accept that Tony claimed the story of madness to get out of prison Because of his hallucinations, which seemed vulgar to start with Which disappeared the moment Broadmoor entered. However, we have evaluated it. We have decided that what he is is that he is upset. "" And in fact, fake the madness It is precisely the kind of cunning and manipulative behavior of the disordered. She is on the list; cunning and manipulative. So claiming that your mind has something wrong It is evidence that your mind already has something wrong. I talked to other experts, They have said that the striped suit - a classic disordered mind. Speaking of points one and two in the list of symptoms; Sweet-spoken, superficial personality charm and a transcendent sense of self-worth. I said, ""Well, he didn't want to mix with other patients?"" Classical disordered, this is evidence of great feeling as well as a lack of sympathy for others. Hence, all things that looked more natural in Tony It was evidence, according to his doctors, However, he was ill in this new way. He was disturbed. His doctor told me, If you wanted to know more about psychopaths, You can go to the Psychopathology Training Course Run by Robert Hare, the man who invented a list of psychopathic symptoms. And that's what I did I went to a psychopathic discovery course, And now I'm certified-- And I must say, I am very skilled-- As a discoverer of psychopaths. Here are the statistics: One in every hundred ordinary people is psychopathic. Well, there are 1,500 people in this room. Fifteen of you are psychopathic. Note that this number increases to 4 percent From executives and businessmen. So I think there is a very good opportunity There would be 30 or 40 psychopathies in this room. A massacre could happen at the end of this night. (Laughter) (laughter) So Herr said that capitalism is at its extreme Rewards psychopathic behavior-- Lack of sympathy for others, sweet talk, Sly, disingenuous. In fact, capitalism is in its cruelest brutality, It is a physical embodiment of psychopathology. It is like the type of psychopathic That is affecting all of us. Hare said to me: ""You know what? Forget this person in Broadmoor And who may, or may not be a paranoia. who cares? This is not an important story. The important story, he says, is ""they are psychopathic companies."" You need to interview some psychopath companies. "" So I made an attempt. I addressed people at Enron. I said, ""Can I have an interview with you in prison To find out if you are psychopathic? "" They did not respond to me. So I changed the tactic this time. I sent an email to Dunlap ""Electric Saw"" Originated since the 1990s. He was involved in companies that fell and cut 30 percent of the workforce Simply referring entire American towns to ghost towns. I sent an email to him and said: ""I think you have a very rare brain defect That makes you special And interested in predatory spirit and not to fear anything. Can I do an interview with you? About your rare brain defect? ​​"" He said: ""Come."" Then, I went to the great Dunlap Palace in Florida Which was filled with sculptures of predators. There were lions and tigers. He was taking me through the garden. There were falcons and eagles. He used to tell me: ""There are sharks."" He was saying this in a less sinister way. ""There are also more sharks and more tigers."" It was like the Kingdom of Narnia. (Laughter) Then we entered his kitchen. Now, Al Dunlop was being brought in to rescue the companies that went bankrupt. He was laying off 30 percent of the workforce. And he would often fire people from joke, For example, one of the most famous stories about him, Someone came to him and said, ""I just bought a new car."" He replied, ""Maybe you have a new car, But let me tell you what you don't have, job. "" Well, in his kitchen, he was standing there with his wife Judy And his bodyguard Sean. I told him, ""I remember how I told you in the email Could there be a rare defect in your brain that makes you unique? "" He said: ""Yes, it is an amazing theory. It's like Star Trek. You go where no one has seen you before. "" I said, ""Well, some psychologists might say This makes you ... ""(grunts) (Laughter) He said ""What?"" I said ""psychopathic."" And then I said, ""I have a full list of psychopathic traits in my pocket. Can I pass it on with you? "" And he seemed very interested against his will, And he said ""Okay, go ahead."" I said, ""Okay, a transcendent sense of self-worth."" And what I have to say is that it was difficult to deny it Because he was standing under a giant oil painting drawn to his person. (Laughter) He said, ""Well, you have to believe in yourself!"" I said ""manipulative."" He said ""This is the leadership."" I said ""shallow expressions: Inability to express the extent of feelings. "" He said, ""Who wants to be burdened with some trivial feelings?"" So, he was passing the points on the psychopathic list Mainly turning it into ""Who Moved My Cheese?"" (Laughter) But I noticed something that happened to me on the day I spent with the Dunlap. Whenever he told me something he looked normal For example, he answered ""No"" to juvenile delinquency. He said he was accepted to West Point, They do not accept people with a history of events at West Point. And none answered in short marital relations. He only got married twice in his life. Acknowledging that his wife mentioned in her divorce papers He once threatened her with a knife. He said that as long as he wondered what the taste of human flesh is, But people say stupid things to each other in bad marriages at the height of verbal quarrels His second marriage lasted for 41 years. So, whenever he tells me about something that might seem non-psychopathic, I say to myself, well I won't put this in my book. Then I realized that by being a psychopath observer It has turned me a little into psychopaths. Because I was striving to squeeze it into a box that reads psychopathic I was striving to know him as crazy as possible. Then I realized, my God. This is what I have been doing for 20 years. This is what all journalists do. We travel around the world with our paper notes in our hands And we are waiting for jewelry. And jewelry is always a ceiling In the characters we meet. And we sew them together like medieval monks. We leave natural things on the ground. This is one of the countries that diagnoses many mental illnesses far more than the reality. Bipolar disorder in children - children four years old They are classified as bipolar disorder Because they have tantrums, Which makes them score high on the list of bipolar disorder. When I returned to London, Tony phoned me. He said, ""Why didn't you answer my calls?"" I said, ""Well, they say you are psychopathic."" He replied, ""I am not psychopathic."" He said ""Do you know what? One of the paragraphs in the list is the lack of remorse, While the other one on the list is furtive, manipulative. When you say that you regret your crime, They say; exactly like psychopathy Cunningly claiming that he feels remorse while he is not. "" It's like magic. They turn everything upside down. He said ""I have a trial soon. Can you come to it? "" I said well Then I went to trial After 14 years in Broadmoor, they let him go out. They decided that he was not supposed to be held indefinitely Because its high scores on a list Which could mean that he has above-average chances of a reversal. So they let him go out. And outside in the hallway he told me, ""Do you know what, John? ""All people are somewhat psychopathic."" He said ""You. I. Well, obviously I am."" I said ""What are you going to do now?"" He said: ""I will go to Belgium Because there is a woman there I dream about. But she is married, so I will make her separate from her husband. (Laughter) Whatever it was, this was two years ago, And here is where my book ended. In the last 20 months, everything was fine. No bad thing happened. He lived with a girl outside London. It was, according to Brian the Scientologist, It replaces the past time - which I know looks sinister, But it is not necessarily doomed. Unfortunately, after 20 months, He returned to prison for a month. He got into a fight in a bar, as he called it-- Which ended up going to prison for a month, Which I know is bad, But it is at least one month that means whatever quarrel, It was not so bad. Then call me on the phone. Do you know what? I think it is right for Tony to be outside. Because we are not supposed to know people about their craziest limits. And what Tony is on is that he's semi-psychopathic. It is a gray area in a world that does not like gray areas. But the gray areas are where you find complexity, Where you find humanity And where you find the truth. Tony told me, John, can I buy you a drink in a bar? I just want to thank you for everything you did for me. "" I did not go. If you were me, what would you do? Thank you (clap)",0
252,in the book and you talk and really eloquently about where you grew up and listening to an interview which you recently you talk even more eloquently about depression and a better battle with depression and just from comments on Amoy social media and people interacting with me when I said I was going to interview you they were kind of blown away by your comments under pression and your comments on dealing with depression I have some questions are gonna put to you from listeners at the end boss you know I think a lot of people were surprised by us a lot of people were surprised to know we've spoken about it before but I hadn't heard personally you speak about it in that kinda way than you did and under Joe Rogan podcast and you were kind of getting emotional as well as that's something that just came out in the moment in the midst of the conversation well my my family going back several generations has been cursed with a particularly vicious form of depression and so it's been quite a catastrophe it really affected my grandfather for decades he was immobilized I would say after the death of his father it was really awful and it hit my father when he was in his late 40s there was there was signs of it before that especially in the winter and my dad's a very competent person and so the fact that that took him down to a large degree was a shock to everyone that knew him including him and then it affected me and it affected my daughter and a number of cousins and like it's really pervasive and so that's been it's nasty it's a nasty even dish you described as trying imagining that your whole family had just been killed the day before and our feeling yeah kind of on a consistent basis well I can tell well I can tell you like an example of it well my daughter has a serious autoimmune condition and it it's very painful she has had 40 affected arthritic joints which is plenty one is plenty three is a lot forty is way more than necessary and she her ankle and her hip deteriorated to the point where they were both replaced when she was 16 and 17 so she basically walked around for two on two broken legs and was on very high doses of painkillers and anyways it was quite the catastrophe and she also has this predisposition to depression and so we talked a lot about both of those things and I asked her one day if she'd rather have the Arthritis or the depression and she said she'd rather have the Arthritis so that's it that's not a bad index and then I talked to her too about trying to describe what it was like to feel that way and she said well it's like your dog just died all the time and she really liked her dog you know it was a real source of comfort to her when she was growing up and then about two years later two years ago our dog died and I asked her well is it like that and she said no it's lot worse than that and so it's not good so what causes it exactly I'm not I'm not clear about it looks like it's part of the audio immune condition that she has there's autoimmune disorders on mice family on both sides and and also on my wife's family so I think my daughter got both got it from both sides so but she she's much much better she's healthy now amazingly enough because I've actually gotten some questions about us and about your choice on who you've changed your toy to just specifically eat meat yes has benefited you I'm benefiting daughter I'm certainly been so far at least well you were it was your daughter that suggested this to you well yes she did she figured it out I would say and then she suggested that I try it and I thought well it had such amazing impact on her it's absolutely unbelievable I still don't believe it that it worked I still can't believe it but she's symptom free she she her depression is gone her fatigue is gone all her joint symptoms are gone she looks great she's doing fine that's amazing as a clinical psychologist and some he was trained in a you know practice center for 90 years is that something you can comprehend no no not really I mean look there has been there is evidence that depression is a lot of different things it's it's one term that covers all sorts of different disorders with all sorts of pathways and there is evidence that one of the functions of antidepressants is anti-inflammatory and that depression is an inflammatory condition and that it's associated with autoimmune dysfunction and so who knows how prevalent that is I mean it's more prevalent than people thought 20 years ago this science independent of my opinion and my daughter's opinion independent of that there's evidence for autoimmune involvement in in in the pathophysiology of depression the degree to which that's a contributor to to what degree that contributes to depression in the general population is unknown but is there a feeling that some of your followers and I don't say followers like you're the Messiah no you don't like that either but some of your fans I suppose yeah or people who bought your book and I'm will going to your shows and download your podcasts you know the lament of depression with some of these guys because obviously and girls because obviously you've said you know you know you know it's individual it's individualism that's that's kind of a portion to be responsible for your own actions and this is what has reverberate yeah which which are fun days yeah yeah you mean about the potential contradiction between those yes yeah oh well yeah I mean look it's it's clearly the case that I think your best bet in life is to shoulder your suffering and to take responsibility and to move forward but that doesn't mean that you're not vulnerable on all sorts of fronts it's just your best tactic just because it's your best tactic doesn't mean it will always work but you don't have a better tactic so you know one of the things we constantly told my daughter was not to ever use her illness as an excuse mostly because it would blur the lines between her and the illness you don't ever want to do that you know so we wanted her to be as responsible as she could be given what she had to endure it was very difficult thing to figure out if you have a kid that's sick like that it's like well they don't want to get up to go to school well you probably wouldn't want to get up either if you were like in pain lots of pain what do you do say you stay in bed or do you say get the hell up if you can and and get out because the alternative is worse and so you know we always pushed her and encouraged her to bear as much as she could and I would say that was the right strategy because she's she did manage to have as much of a life as she could have under that condition stances and she's come through all this with her character intact so which i think is really quite beyond belief to me but it still seems to be the case so it isn't that shouldering your suffering and and bearing the responsibility for your life is a panacea because we're vulnerable to all sorts of things that happen to us that are in some sense ultimately uncontrollable and that's why people die right but it doesn't matter in the face of that there still isn't a better strategy  [Music] [Applause],0
233,"thank you very much grab a seat how you guys doing who hates math raise your hand good good to know where you are who loves math raise your hand and who's sort of in the middle and could care less about math okay that's all right because we're gonna try to tip you the other way all right like Jim said my name is Scott Flensburg I'm in the Guinness Book of World Records as the fastest human calculator and so I'm gonna do a demonstration for you in a minute but the most time we're gonna spend today is on you it's not about me I have a gift and I want to share it with you but I believe the most important time we can share today is making sure that you can leave here doing something that you never thought you could do to truly in caps encapsulate that superhero feeling and so to get started it is James in the bag come on up James everybody give James hey he's gonna run the calculator for us we have a calculator okay so I have to get started I am NOT an athlete I'm a mathlete all right all of you athletes know that you have to stretch out your body first and warm up but as a mathlete I have to warm up my brain first so we're gonna do some basic stuff and then try harder stuff as we go but I'll need some volunteers to pick some numbers so we need some really heavy voices probably to be able to have everybody here so I don't have a volunteer anybody I need okay and start right in the front what's your name Anton so let's start off with addition all right let's do two-digit numbers to get started so you'll say like seventy-three I'll say plus you say another two-digit number I'll say plus back and forth we're gonna go I'm gonna try to add them up in my head he's gonna do it on the calculator I have screens all around me so it's very easy to cheat I do not want to cheat I don't need to cheat so I will close my eye so I'm gonna go away over here next to James so I can't see these screens I'll be over here there's nothing personal against that side of the room I just want to make sure I'm not cheating so Anton you ready we've got a zero on the board right where's our calculators we got a zero okay I'll close my eyes you're gonna say a number I'll say Plus back and forth we go you ready okay loud and clear ready go ahead plus plus plus plus plus plus one more 3:54 yeah all right good job Anton thank you very much thank you now I'm just curious how many of you can do that remember your reaction to me asking you that most you started laughing out loud some of you totally dismissed it but I promise you every one of you in this room can do what I just did adding up a bunch of two-digit numbers in my head with no pencil no paper I figured out how to do that when I was 9 years old so I'll share it with you and it's real easy all right but let's keep moving forward you need another volunteer somebody's strong voice please you want to try it you got to shout it out okay what's your name Kate Kate let's do a little more addition please let's try three-digit numbers all right so I'll move over here James ready to go so you say three-digit number Plus back and forth we go from ready when you are I don't have to shout awesome three five six just say it normal like a human 356 plus 120 sorry 123 56 plus 120 Plus 742 Plus 893 plus 567 one more 129 2797 oh I think you guys typed it in wrong just so you know all right let's just check oh we can look at the numbers will rewind the tape all right but I promise you I can usually do this very well all right now let's try one more I need one more volunteer please somebody else with a microphone okay yeah stay in the same table thank you all right let's try one more three-digit or I just want to make sure I'm still warming up go ahead 392 plus 6 81 plus 9 16 plus 243 see it's the calculator isn't it ah see the heck we don't have to do any more unredeemed all right so let's move on let's try something tougher we'll try a multiplication all right let's clear the calculator James thanks buddy you're making me look good don't worry about it all right when I strike multiplication all right let's try 2 2 numbers and I want to multiply them together while he does it on there 96 times 74 that's 296 seven 104 right seven 104 let's try another one Khan get faster as we go it's alright 83 I'll do that 83 three times 91 that's seven five five three right yeah all right and I'm not memorizing this I'm calculating I promise you all right let's try one more volunteer please somebody close to him if you don't mind just to keep it logistically easy oh hi how are you doing well thank you what's your name Tim rice okay let's try let's try something tougher what do we do there that's too easy right cuz you can even do that right let's try a division all right let's do three-digit divided by a one-digit you use weird numbers so we'll get some decimals and stuff all right so three digit by one digit 337 divided by 567 point four those are easy let's try another one come on make it tough okay 982 982 divided by seven 140 point two eight five seven one four two eight five seven one four two eight five seven right all right okay got it done we're good good job all right thank you all right so I guess I'm warmed up now and who has a calculator and right in front of them real handy oh if you just I only need one or two James is gonna do this but I could cheat because there's too many screens but if you have a calculator or an iPhone or you know you want to do this go ahead I usually do square roots but square roots are really easy people memorize square roots it's easy to figure those so we're gonna try cube roots a little bit tougher all right so on your calculator clear the calculator and James you do this to I won't look all right everybody punch in like a crazy two-digit number to get started and then hit the x key and then hit the same two-digit number again and hit the x key and hit the same two-digit number again and hit equals so you should get a big answer on your screen right so everybody that did that you got it and you don't have an e on your screen tell me the answer you came up with and what I'll do is extract the cube root out of that number you see what I mean all right so James would you come up with 47 yeah use 47 all right let's try another one come on who else yet loud and clear please 99 okay let's try a tougher one all the way in the back I missed the first one really really 23 I think yeah yeah it's one of my favorites let's try another one come on somebody else somebody else get one way in the bag go ahead 25 yeah let's try one more  82 yeah that's your I graduated high school almost go ahead 328 509 is 69 very good all right one more anybody else got tough one yeah one more 77 right yeah he tried my nemesis number that's good all right so so now I can do numbers in my head right you believe me I'm a human calculator I have this superpower since I was nine years old when I was 11 my buddy had a calculator his name's Andrew McKay I always give them credit because your friends ask you the best questions sometimes it opened up windows and opportunities in your life that you never would have found yourself with all these blind spots Andrew happen to ask me a great question at the right moment on a calculator that he had punch in 5 + 5 please James and you should get 10 right so now if James hits equals one more time what will the calculator say I heard three different answers I heard 10 15 and 20 which one do you think it is it's 15 go ahead James hit equals and keep hitting equals get a nice little rhythm and just show them how calculator counts by a number this is called a constant my buddy had a calculator he's like Scott we know you can do all these basic addition subtraction multiplication division can you do this our calculator is counting by a number I'm just kidding equal so he did 28 plus 28 equals and you started hitting equals and it wanted me to add 28 over and over again and it was like a sense awoke in my brain I'll never forget it was in front of mr. Murphy's class remember everything about it and I'm sitting there in his 2856 84 it just started making sense to me and so I want to demonstrate that for you first all right so somebody over here please pick a two-digit number you'd like me to count by good number 27 plus 27 equals and you'll see that my brain gets going faster and faster all right so tell me when you ready James you ready to rock and roll okay so 27 plus 27 is 54 81 one zero eight one three five one six two one eight nine two one six two four three two seven zero two nine seven three two four three five one three seven eight four oh five four three two four five nine four eight six five one three five four zero five six seven five nine four six two one six four six seven five seven oh two seven two nine seven five six seven eight three eight one zero eight three 76 forty nine one nine one eight nine four five nine seven two nine nine nine yada yada yada like that oh three more three more two one more yeah there you are James good job 99 all right so that's my gift that I discovered when I was very young and everybody's like you know what he do with that you didn't nobody know what to do with me my teacher thought I was an alien they don't you know no one's talked to me so it's just a gift nobody had to do with it well I got very blessed a friend of mine in Los Angeles his name's Eric Schatz he has a company called l m n o productions and i did a show for them a long time ago called how they do that and it's all about networking you know it amazes me because years later Eric got the rights to Guinness World Records TV show in America and he called me up as a friend and said Scott what can we do with you to get you into the Guinness Book World Records to get on the TV show and then we talked about it I said you know there's just one thing I can do this counting by a number there he goes yeah that's pretty crazy let's see if we can do that so here's the contest they set up they found the fastest accountant in the world that can run a ten key calculator to race me counting by a number so the judge chose the number 38 so I had to add 38 plus 38 plus 38 out loud as fast as I could racing this guy on a calculator doing 3/8 plus 3/8 plus 3/8 plus sir as fast as he could at the end of the 15 seconds he had 28 answers and I had 35 so actually beat the Machine by seven since then I've been invited to break that world record and London on TV there I did it with 36 and in Japan I got 237 answers in 15 seconds so I want to demonstrate for you what it sounds like when I'm going full-speed because that first example you can tell I was slow medium fast and then I go crazy that's what I'm just gonna go crazy all right so sir would you pick a two-digit number  72 I like that all right so 72 plus 72 this time gonna try to go full speed if anybody has a clock if you have 15 seconds anybody who's got a watch clock anybody who's gonna be a timer come on the iPhone has timers you guys know that all right we have one so when I say 72 you just start 15 second clock and when I finish just say stop or shut up or whatever you want all right you ready okay we're doing 72 right ready James you got it okay I'm ready to go 7 2 1 4 4 2 1 6 2 8 8 3 6 0 4 3 2 5 before five seven six six four seven two zero seven nine two eight four nine three six one zero zero eight one zero zero one one five two one two two four two nine six one three six eight one four four zero five one two and five a four one six five six one seven two eight one eight hundred one eight seven two one nine four four 2016-2018 one six zero two two three three two three or four two three seven six three four four eight two four four eight let's see well that's divided by 72 you should have thirty four something like that I don't know that should be 35 go ahead divided by 72 that'll be 35 answers so 34 so you can see how fast I have to everything has to be perfect to get to 37 so thank you very much and what I didn't get to do on that show that I'd love to do now is it was so funny we did this and I beat the calculator the judge comes over and he says Scott you're in the Guinness Book of World Records and I don't know I don't know why but if you go to a public school and you open up the library and you look in the library the Guinness Book World Records is and every school kids are fascinated by this book when I go to schools and kids introduce me by opening up the Guinness Book World Records and reading your world record all the other kids in the room it changes everything it's an amazing thing to be in the Guinness Book World Records it's really an honor that didn't realize how much energy would have in my mission but what was funny was good to the commercial break and the judge said Scott you beat the machine you're in the book he goes but we think you're cheating I was like how do you cheat counting by 72 he goes well we think maybe you've just memorized all these numbers here we are at Jim quicks memory class right I mean you could memorize this stuff Jim if Jim just took a month off you could memorize all the answers and count by 72 - pretty fast and I said but that's not what I do first off I think calculating is faster than men Murr is a ssin I can beat any memorization person on the planet Earth with calculation I believe our minds calculate faster than they retrieve memory memories second place okay but what I'm going to demonstrate for you is that I'm not memorizing this that I can count by any number all right so let's go to this table over here sir would you pick let's live on the edge calculator always starts at zero so they thought I memorized every number starting at zero I said what if I could just count by starting at any number then count by seventy-two they said all right that would prove to us you're not remember Jim you would agree that's tough to memorize every number for every number right full-time job all right so pick a three digit numbers our new zero for this example prime number almost 291 times three and 97 times nine but it's good number 873 hold it against you all right so I just kidding so 873 now I promise you have never done this pattern before I don't even know he's gonna say next but I've never practiced starting at age 73 so he had Plus now what two digit number you want me to count by starting at 873 so you're ready to go James you got eight ninety nine nine two five nine five one nine seven seven one zero zero three one zero two nine one zero five five one zero eight one one 107 one one three three one one five nine one one 85 one two one one one two three seven one two six three one two eight nine one three one five one three four one one three six seven one three ninety three one for my nine one four four five one four seven yada-yada-yada it just keeps going my brain is wired like a calculator alright so thank you uh so I am not memorizing I'm calculating so today I want to show you that each one of you have a calculator in your brain I'm very honored to be on a show right now called superheroes with Stan Lee an amazing thing I just got back from Scandinavia kids every kid has watched that show over there on the discovery or the History Channel it's an amazing vehicle it's really an honor to be considered a superhuman right I mean you know it's very rare and it to be on that show is one thing but one of the things I just want to show you real quick is this before you go James alright coz easier if you're here is that okay we'll do this one alright so I have a gift to be the human calendar as well I can calculate dates alright so you can give me any date in history and I can figure out what day of the week it was on alright so do we have any people remember like kids birthday a wedding something like that okay way in the back just start with month/day/year Wednesday about 3:30 just kidding all the time but 66 wins there right way to stay there you go alright come on it's tougher dates yep October 2nd 47 right Thursday you're born on a Thursday let's see if he can get there should be dude see House computers are so slow right there there you go was that wood October 2nd I think he said 46 didn't he what did you say 47 I said it right anyway I got a lot of lucky guess yeah go ahead Anton go ahead Oh a future day will be a Thursday it's almost Friday the 13th but not quite I think I don't know I'm just guessing at this point I just hoped James makes me looking at Kim on James Thursday all right good job buddy all right so I can calculate any day of the week and figure out what day of the week it was on it seems like a different type of trick like what purpose would that serve but it played a big role in my life and so I want to share that with you next but first can we give James a big hand for helping out buddy thank you about it great job there a good senior person all right I'll see out all right so now we're gonna think like a calculator to show you all these things that I've done and that I said I could teach you how to do there's a couple things I want to show you and we're gonna start with this app on the iPad it's called white board Pro let me make sure that it's uh see it works it's just a little tricky all right so here we go everybody take a look at this I'm gonna write something down that you all did when you're about nine years old our teacher made us write these 10 numbers across the page and I'll never forget this day it was in 4th grade I was 9 years old and our teacher wrote down 0 through 9 and I was uh I was not a good student I was more of a troublemaker and bored and you know just trying to fill the time and for some reason I stopped my teacher and I said hey wait a minute who picked those shapes why does the Ford look like that why does the 7 look what does the 3 look like the 2 who picked those shapes why did they pick those shapes and my teacher looked at me like wow you know I've never even thought about that I don't know the answer that she has some math friends they didn't know the answer to it we started asking more people nobody could tell me the answer I was like how it was it we're using these and nobody can even tell me where they came from or why they look like they do so it's taken me about 30 years I've searched the world and what I want to do is first introduce to you what I call chapter zero I believe it's the missing chapter in math that if we would all learn what you're about to learn now first it would give every kid on our planet a chance to really understand math but we what we start off wrong here's first office look at how many numbers are up there how many numbers did I write down 10 is there a 10 on there anywhere no so when you turn on a calculator look at this calculator how many buttons have numbers on that machine there's 10 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 there's no 10 on a calculator but here's what we do to kids and you guys have all done this your whole life as we confuse people because here's what we do the human body has 10 fingers we've all learned to do this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 that's indoctrinated in our brain it is everywhere and this is what's confusing us because when you turn on a calculator it always starts at 0 the only reason the calculator works is because it starts at 0 so if you want to turn on your calculator you have to start at 0 so watch this 10 fingers 10 digits 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 it's really 0 through 9 no magic it's just thinking like a calculator so everybody please take your hands put them up in the air shake out that 1 through 10 bunch of crazy Romans did that to us close your fist and now start with 0 the first finger you ready 0  so now you're all thinking like a calculator zero through nine so I can share with you the different things that happened to me that allowed me to have this sense of numbers I guess but look at the shapes up here I asked my teacher where'd the shades come from they didn't know I found the answer I think the inventors of this language we're fighting the Roman numerals the Roman numerals were the biggest number system in the world the Roman Empire was managing the world basically and so Roman numerals were what we're trusted your finances were done in Roman numerals everything in society was done in Roman numerals they were trusted this was like magic this was this new invention this new language of numbers so nobody trusted them so they were doing everything they could to make this as easy as possible to teach they came up with a brilliant idea the shapes were meant to be able to communicate to you the value of each shape by how many angles are in the shape so it looked a little bit differently the zero is a circle how many angles in a circle zero so when you look at that shape you know there's a value of zero the number one started out a little bit differently it started like that and this shape gives you one angle right there so everybody knew that shape had a value of 1 the number 2 started out like our letter Z and this shape gives you one two angles so everybody knew that shape had a value of two the number three started out like a hieroglyph looked like that this shape gives you one two three angles 3 corners so everybody knew that I had a value of 3 the number 4 looked a little differently it started out like this and this shape gives you 1 2 oh let me go back here to - 1 2 3 4 angles see how that works pretty easy right I mean it makes sense when you started thinking about it 5 was tough they had to put a tail on it this gives you 1 2 3 4 5 angles 5 corners 6 was really easy they just put a box on it looked like that this shape will give you 1 2 three four five six corners six angles and when I'm doing shows in schools it's always funny because the kids don't care about anything till they get to seven so like how you gonna get seven angles out of that but somebody really brilliant came up with this they added two lines this gives you one two three four five six seven isn't that so simple right but who took me we're gonna take me like centuries to figure that out and now eight eight was easiest one it's just an hourglass one two three four five six seven eight all right and nine was the tough one they called this one the ugly duckling looked pretty bad but it got the job done that's nine angles right there one two three four five six seven eight nine so why don't we learn that in like third grade everybody should know that I just seemed so cool when I showed us the students they feel connected to numbers they feel like they know something they didn't know before it makes them feel like numbers they could understand a better might be their friend so this is what was happened to me in fourth grade everybody got that cool easy right okay so now let's go back to the numbers again zero through nine and now same day our teacher now wants us to write down these ten numbers again and this time we have to spell them so in your head spell each number zero zer o1 o ne and so on what number up there when you spell it has the same number of letters as its number value for four is spelled F oh you are maybe it's because I was in fourth grade I was fascinated on the number four and fourth grade maybe but I was writing down these answers and I noticed that four had four letters and I was just so excited I ran up to my teacher I was like this is incredible four has four letters and she's like what's wrong with you Scott who cares the four has four letters I said it's really cool because no other number does that zero doesn't have zero letters one doesn't have one letter seven doesn't have seven letters the only number in English that has the same number of letters as its number value is the number four I was so intrigued by that and that's what made me notice the next thing is take a look at the numbers up here which numbers up here when you spell them use 4 letters say it when you see them I heard five what else zero that's the one people usually miss there's another one I heard it nine so we have zero four five and nine are all four-letter words and maybe you noticed how many numbers have four letters four so I'm freaking out again I wrote it to my teacher I go check this out four numbers have four letters she's like who cares what's the big deal I said this is this is the way I mean it makes sense because look it splits your numbers when you're doing it this way watch where the four-letter words end up 0 through 4 5 through 9 the four letter words are bookends on your fingers to help you remember to count from 0 to 4 5 to 9 10 has nothing to do with numbers alright everybody cool and then one other number it's no big deal but I have to bring it up because it was a really funny moment my teacher I was working on the number 7 and I was looking at the word spelled se ve N and I caught it right away I don't know why maybe you guys still haven't noticed and he eventually did but if you cross off the S you end up with the word even but 7 is an odd number so I just walked up to my teacher I said who put the word even in an odd number why did you do that she's like oh I never noticed that before no big deal I was like are you kidding me this is a huge problem we have to fix this immediately and she I didn't even sleep that night I was so distraught over this but it hit me the next day we had to change 7 to sod try it one time you're not liking it that's ok it's alright it's probably not gonna catch on but and it would mess up my whole four letter word things so it's okay but this is how I started thinking about numbers and it was really challenging for my teachers because I was asking all these crazy questions they didn't know I was coming from next but the next day is the day that changed my life fourth grade mrs. loves class Herkimer New York I am in the back of the room where I always sat next to my best friend him and I were on the same baseball team and we would talk about math the whole time and for some reason our teacher was showing us how to do this we had to learn how to add numbers where you carry all right so 7 plus 2 is 9 10 14 carrot so can anybody tell me the answer to that I think I already heard it I did 54 who got that so quick Wow that was very cool I'll quiz you later all right so let's let's try this how'd everybody do it when I asked you to add this up did you go 7 plus 2 is 9 plus 1 is 10 plus 4 is 14 write down the 4 carry the 1 1 2 3 4 plus the 1 is 5 is that how you do it worst way to add absolutely the worst way to add those four numbers together and yet we teach every kid on the planet to do that I got really lucky that day because I was not paying attention to my teacher I did not I didn't hear that we had to add these numbers up from the right and then carry and all that stuff I did not hear a word and she saw me not paying attention she said Scott why don't you come on up and do this problem for us I was totally busted I'm walking up to the front of the room thinking I already hate math I'm gonna hate math even more now when I get done with this I get up to the board and for some reason my brain went backwards I started over here at the tens I said that's a 10 that's a 10 that's a 10 that's a 10 so I started keeping a running total in my head 10 plus 10 is 20 plus 10 is 30 plus 10 is 40 and then I just kept going 40 plus 7 is 47 plus 2 49 plus 150 plus 4 54 and I just wrote down the answer my teacher was amazed that I got it right because she thought I was not listening and she said Scott how did you get this answer where's your carrier you're supposed to put a 1 up here I said I don't even know what you're talking about what's a what's a carry she goes you have to start over here and go this way carry and I said all I started over here I went this way she was know you have to go this way I said but I'm faster than you going this way she's alright you do this so everybody try this one on your own see how you do just raise your hand when you get the answer please don't say it out loud so everybody can experience it  just raise your hand already come on keep them up I want to see you again Center who's not getting it really what's the answer say it 88 you know it's funny when I started the show I added up a whole bunch of two-digit numbers I raced the calculator I beat the calculator got it right the first one and I stopped the show and I asked all of you how many of you can do that if you remember your reaction you all started laughing out loud like that even asked you know less want to show you how to do it how many of you got that right almost everybody in the room first try if you'll practice this for five minutes ask your friends or family to write down some two-digit numbers practice adding them up you'll be able to do this faster in your head than anybody on a calculator 20 40 60 70 79 88 boom start grouping you're gonna be like that little kids do this little third fourth fifth graders beating their teachers punching the numbers into the calculator so when I asked you if you could do that and you all started laughing you didn't think you could do it and now you know how easy it is and you can do it here's my next question to you what else can you do that you didn't think you could do what are the limits do we put on ourselves what limits are we putting on our kids with our education system and our mentality and society how we think like this limits our brain activity limits our potential it doesn't allow us to reach our potential so this was an accident that happened to me in fourth grade that changed my life because from that point forward I would always look for an easier way to get the answer when we started learning division multiplication all these things I would look for easier ways to get the answer just give you one more example because I want to move on to something else is multiplication what 7 times 7 9 times 9 12 times 12 no math you have all memorized those questions not one person in this room calculated anything you all memorize this stuff we teach our kids to memorize their math 7 plus 7 9 times 9 these are all memorized they're not learning if they're memorizing it so they get the passing grade teacher gets paid the parents are happy and then they wake up in algebra and go what happened what's going on you know no understanding of basic arithmetic so I just want to show you one more thing that had me what's 7 times 11 4 times 1111 is a magic number I was 11 years old when I noticed this so it really got my attention here's how we do arithmetic 24 times 11 not just in America but around the world we teach kids to go like this 4 times 1 is 4 2 times 1 is 2 don't forget the zero where it's all wrong 4 times 1 is 4 2 times 1 is 2 you add these all together is that how you guys multiply worse way to multiply all right so let me show you the fastest way there's six ways to multiply numbers together but we only teach one the worst one by the way it literally is a trick but I can't get into all those today but I just want to show you this one about the number 11 because that was 11 when I noticed this but watch how easy 11 is any number times 11 3 steps to getting the answer first step just take this back number and drop it down here on the back take the front number drop it into the front and then just add them together what's 2 plus 4 6 and put it in the middle same answer no hardly any work right it's so easy it's an easy mental exercise so let's try it I'm gonna erase that let's all try one let's do 32 times 11 what's the answer 3 2 what's in the middle 5 so what is 43 times 11 473 you're not doing a lot of arithmetic but you're not memorizing anything either this gives your kids a chance to break out of that 10 by 10 memory box that we make kids go through all right okay so I'm not I talked to Jim about this before the show and I want to do more math but I only have so much time and I really want to get into something that's very time sensitive I didn't know what to do with my gift I was in school my parents didn't know what to do with me my teachers didn't know what to do me I was in upstate New York we didn't have a gifted program and I was not very attentive to if I was more into sports so I was more of a distraction for my teachers and I ended up not graduating high school I failed English my senior year by one point and they would not give my high school diploma in New York you have to have an English credit your senior year I had scholarships for math baseball different things forfeited everything Regents scholarships it was a very painful day in my life my teacher failed me by one point on an essay so that I couldn't graduate and it was a brutal brutal day had to turn in my gown miss my graduation event canceled my party it was a you know it's it was a brutal day brutal week and I decided to run and so I joined the United States Air Force and I left upstate New York and I got as far away as I could I went in the Air Force they heard about my skills and they took me to Japan as a special duty assignment I got to do some crazy stuff learn Japanese do all kinds of really crazy projects things like that it was a lot of fun but about four or five years into my Air Force time my sons my supervisors son failed second grade math and he said hey can you sit down with Travis and just talk to him show him show him some things we know you're good with numbers I set that one for 30 minutes the next day his school called and said I don't know what you told this kid but you got to come in and talk to the rest of the class I had never spoken publicly I walked into a group of 2nd and 3rd graders or maybe 25 of them I had the most amazing 40 minutes of my life those kids were so excited about what I could do but more importantly they were so excited about what I was showing them I was like holy cow I have this god-given ability but to find a way to use it to inspire others just dream come true I ran back to my base I said I got to get some time off please give me the afternoons off so I can start visiting more schools and my supervisor my big supervisor said no absolutely not so I snuck in some schools when I could on my own private time and I just kept getting more and more requests and so I finally decided to get kicked out of the Air Force on purpose which is a very awkward thing to do and to do it without going to jail is really tricky so it took me a little bit I got out and the thing is they gave me a big reenlistment bonus when I reached and so they wanted all that back so I woke up on 8 888 with nothing the Air Force had taken my car and then what others you know like the stereo whatever just stuff that you know I'd blown my reenlistment bonus on and I had nothing except my old car from high school 65 Buick Skylark convertible I pawned it for $1,200 bought a $700 plane ticket to LA to get on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson I'd spoken with him on the phone and I went out there had a great meeting and they said great we love you you're gonna be on the show give us your phone numbers like I don't have a number they're like well just give us how do we get ahold I was like I don't know you know I have 200 hours in my pocket I've never been to Los Angeles I need to be on the show like tonight and basically you know that's not how it works I ended up homeless in Los Angeles for a month 28 days never forget it just do what you can and I met this guy who had a company called Cameroon name of it sorry but it was just a small business and it was right on wolves for Bulevar and he said Scott I'll let you run this part of the office during the day and at night you can use my office as an apartment I have a shower bathroom you can just use it as an apartment during the day you work and at night you can stay here and I was like wow this is great so I got a gig in a place to stay all the same time well the only bummer was 28 days later got kicked out and his company got shut down so I lost my job in my house the same day you know so good and bad so I ended up with nothing there and he goes hey I got a friend in Florida who wants you to fly down there and help him with his project he's got a little money he wants to get started so I flew down to West Palm Beach Florida and this guy had invented a glow-in-the-dark doorknob for hotel rooms for security for emergency accidents I was like wow that's either brilliant or ridiculous but they're gonna pay me so I'm gonna go try to sell it so 30 days we met every major hotel chain in Florida and we sold zero glow-in-the-dark doorknobs so I was out of money I was out of time this guy didn't have anything left I had nothing I called my family my little sister Cindy was living in Phoenix Arizona and she she said Scott just get to the airport I got a plane ticket waiting for you and you know come to Phoenix you can stay at my boyfriend's house for a while get situated so I was right after 8888 I'm waiting in West Palm Beach I have nothing to do that and I'd have nowhere to stay I have 20 hours before my flight and I walk into the West Palm Beach public library and I found I'm going through the math which most homeless people do you know when they're hanging out of the library's mouths exit and I walked through and I see this little book it's like this bag and this thin it's ancient it's over a hundred years old and nobody checked it out in like 50 years and the guy had said that there's a calendar a way to calculate the day of the week of the calendar I was like all right you know it's all numbers I got I can handle the numbers so let's see what the formula is so I wrote down after a few hours of looking at it reading through how he was doing it I took on a three and a half by five index card with a little pencil that you get at the library and I wrote down this little algorithm put it in my pocket got on the plane the next day and got this algorithm in my head so that I could figure out what day of the week it was on I landed in Phoenix my little sister Cindy picks me up at the airport I said Cindy what's your birthday July 23rd 60 I was like oh you were born on a Tuesday she goes who cares I was like great that's gonna be a good skill as it's worked out now serving as the global ambassador of world math state which I'll tell you about at the end every school I visit hundreds of kids the best part is not my show the best part is afterwards the kids all get a card for me and they put their name in their birthdate down and I get to have a moment with them I get to say their name I get to look at their birthday I get to tell them it was a Tuesday or a Friday autograph it just have a few seconds with each kid and that is the coolest part of what I do I get to see the kids reactions to what I taught them during the show I get to do something not just some random math trick I'm giving their birthday these kids are running home and saying mom was I born on a Friday this guy figured it out in half a second it connects me with them on a whole different level it's really turned into something special for me but we have a very special day coming up very soon 12-21-12 for those of you don't know that's the end of the Mayan calendar you've you've all heard about this right ok so I don't have to get into that the Mayan calendar comes to an end of a cycle on December 21st 2012 after I discovered that I could calculate the day of the week all these other questions started coming to my head why do we use a calendar that's so difficult to figure out what day of the week a date is on hee the algorithm you have to do to figure out what day of the week a date is on you have to take the year plus the year divided by four plus the date plus the month divided by seven that's what I have to do to calculate what day of the week that date is on I have to put all those numbers in all those variables for those you that are writing it down just so you have it if you want it here are the variables for the months each month has a number valued it's not 1 through 12 it goes like this January's is 0 February is three marches 3 April 6 May 1 June is 4 July is 6 August to September 5 October 0 November 3 December 5 those are the values you got to know so there's all kinds of numbers floating around but I won't get into the algorithm of this as much as I will the questions that made me ask why are we using this crazy calendar do you know the calendar we use is called the what calendar Gregorian calendar anybody know why it's called Gregorian Pope Gregory the 13th and 1569 realized that the calendar we were using from the time of Julius Caesar was miscalculating leap years they were miscalculating leap years this whole time so the only reason I don't say the only reason the big reason the Roman calendar the Gregorian calendar exists is to calculate Easter Easter is the big day it has to be after a full moon after the spring equinox there's all these little variables that have to be added up to keep this thing this very special day to them on the right day because they miscalculated they were off by 10 days so from 1569 to 1582 Pope Gregory and his team tried to figure out what to do and here was what they did everybody went to bed October 5th 1582 and they woke up on October 15 15 8 they decided to just skip 10 days people missed birthdays weddings pay rent I mean if people were crazy Russia was so mad that an adopter for like 300 years it was they were so upset it really offended everybody but the Pope did it papal decree he couldn't do that today just say hey let's just skip 10 days the Roman calendar makes no sense we start the year on January 1st can anybody tell me why why do we start the year on January 1st  you",0
132,"absolutely awesome I couldn't believe what I could see it was over the horizon that many ships ships everyplace thousands as far as you could see as the Emperor toward Tokyo the largest fleet ever assembled approached the Japanese island province of Okinawa  there were more than 40 carriers 18 battleships 200 destroyers it was faster than the invasion fleet at Normandy nearly 200,000 troops had boarded at 11 ports from Seattle and San Francisco to Leyte in the Philippines we had the failing of confidence because all these big guns were firing in there and we thought well with all this artillery that probably killed most of the Japs all will be easy their mission as the Japanese High Command had predicted was to take Okinawa and use it as a staging area for an invasion of Japan's main islands only 350 miles away  the troops who landed knew this could be the Imperial Army's last battle before it defended the main islands they knew the Japanese would fight to the death  oh man you're scared to death it's no question about it your it was frightened as a man could be as you go in but there was no shooting going on nothing happened which was real strange once while you'd hear a gunshot someplace but nothing happened nothing zero everybody was shot there was no resistance at all they went out on April 1 they thought what is this an April Fool's joke where the chaps with all this big build-up on the boat they told us about the ferocious snakes and chaps are worse than the snakes and we're going in there and it's gonna be maybe the final battle and then there's nobody on the beach for five days American forces were unopposed as they headed south an admiral radio Chester Nimitz commander of the Pacific Fleet I may be crazy but it looks as if the Japanese have quit the war at least in this sector and Nimitz wired back delete everything after I may be crazy  general Mitsuru Ujima could smile from his mountain headquarters beneath ancient shuri castle he was luring his enemy into a trap gooshie Jima was very smart he followed a theory the Americans called a cornered rat theory terrains everything here and the southern part of the otter the terrain explains it's a series of ridges in the south so he does steel concrete and coral Garrison's inside the mountains so he has two things you need to win a battle he has concealment and he's got the advantage of height  the first major line of defense was a kakuzu ridge bush ademÃ¡s command post was under shuri castle four miles south in the main line of defense these ridges ran the width of the island there were no open flanks the army's commander decided to storm the ridges you got up every morning and it would be another craggy rock piled hill and in the army infantry would take off over whatever open the ground there was chaptered then lay into them and we try to keep them down with our machine gun and that was like a continuum every day it was the same story only different guys got hit and different guys got killed I used to look at those infantry guys go across so of course those fields god it's tough to believe  the Army's sending tanks - does she know Sean any nice to see conscripts were ordered to deliver bombs to kakuzu for destroying us tanks carried ten kilogram bombs on our shoulders and headed for kakuzu at night the Americans launched a starship and then came the gunfire what the show we had to hide in the shade whenever a star shell was up but finally we managed to deliver the bombs to kakuzu Chicago Auto at the Dix terrible sauce back then I heard that the next morning when the tanks came hastily armed the bombs saw you and made suicide attacks you know the tanks I know he's shown a no Cody mess after nearly a month of attack and counter-attack Marines relieved a shattered Army division we get down there and we were in a particular place with wounded left on stretchers they had to evacuate very quickly and we found the wounded Americans dismembered and mutilated horrible we found the laying there with the heads cut off and the hands cut off and that private parts and their mouth just hated them God did we hate them and we wanted to kill him you talk to the average marine he enjoyed us and that sounds bloodthirsty but it's true you enjoyed it that was one less chap we had to worry about they had not been killing men a veteran recalled they were wiping out dirty animals we just looked at him at they were just just something to eliminate we well we didn't think of them as a humans or anything like that if you see him shooting and that's the way we all felt  when you're fighting an enemy that will not surrender that considers surrender disgraceful and punishes prisoners who do surrender for being unmanly it treats them that way this is a war that's got to fly out of control and the atrocities really begin to mount in early May after a month of fighting US forces approached Japan's main defensive line there was a hill on it Marines called Sugar Loaf one remembers it as a pimple of a hill you  could have run the six hundred yards across that plane and up Sugar Loaf Hill he recalled in a few minutes  the defenses of general Matsuda Luigi Japan's commander on Okinawa were so thorough it would take the sixth Marine Division seven days and 14 attempts by some counts the battle for Sugar Loaf Hill was the hardest for Americans anywhere in World War two when we first went up Sugar Loaf Hill we had a number of people shot in the back couldn't believe it how did he get shot in the back when you assaulting a hill but it was coming from all sides and the Japs were just zeroing in on US Marines encountered fire from positions dug into the front of the hill mortars lobbed from the back of the hill fire from neighboring hills and artillery from shuri castle almost a mile away sugarloaf could be resupplied by tunnels they ran from shuri castle to all the supporting hills if sugarloaf fell general issue Gemma's main line of defense would collapse marines soon realized it was not about to fall we found out that okinawa had been used for a Japanese artillery range for over 50 years so they knew every inch of it and they could drop a shell in your back pocket so we were completely exposed going up that hill the Marines tried again we just went down there and when we got on the hill and all this open ground behind us they shot us up and killed a lot of people wounded a lot of people at least a third of our company  sacrificial charges they get repelled again and again they actually get to the summit get in a firefight with the Japanese and get pushed off the rock pushed off the hill  the Marines kept assaulting sugarloaf hill  we took that hill 13 times 13 times then the night then come back from the back of the hill from under the hill from beside the hill and that counter-attack we suffered terrible casualties and would have to pull back a little bit  torrential rains and mud also hindered their advance there was no way to bury the dead the Marines lived among them  night time brought its own terrors these sneak attacks at night it's psychological warfare and works in a lot of cases it drove a lot of Marines nuts this one person he was right next to me and it was a transient we were in waiting for the word to muadh all of a sudden he started crying and pulling grass out and putting in his mouth and stuff like that  more than 1200 Marines would leave the battle of sugarloaf hill with what was called combat fatigue  on the seventh day the artillery fire that softened up Sugar Loaf Hill and its neighboring Hills was unusually heavy  then the Marines cleared out the side hills tanks encircled Sugarloaf and attack the backside caves  after seven days the Battle of Sugar Loaf Hill was over Okinawa main line of defense began to crumble general Yuchi Jima began to retreat  American casualties at Sugarloaf Hill were more than 2,500  Emperor Hirohito wanted a final decisive battle general Lucia Jima was trying to wage it the idea is to bleed the Americans it's a dual strategy you can't win the war but you can bleed them such an extent that we can get better peace terms  the longer we prolong it the longer that fleet sits out there and is susceptible to kamikaze air attack they thought the combination of the two along war of savage attrition taking casualties and then the slaughter at sea might convince the Americans that an invasion would be insanity",0
77,this is my ammo box heater in combination with a copper coil it circulates heated water from a nearby campfire wood stove or solar heater into itself  this setup serves two main functions number one it can be used as an off-grid water heater secondly it can be used as an off-grid space heater which is what I built mine for last year I constructed a snowmobile camper since then I've been exploring ways to heat it during the winter months and by the way if you want to check out my snowmobile camper series I'll leave a link in the description below anyway my plan is to run hot water from an outside campfire into my camper where it will circulate into this metal ammo box the ammo box will radiate its heat inside the camper making it toasty warm even when it's freezing cold outside this setup is a great way to bring the heat of the fire inside while keeping the fire itself safely outside I chose this ammo box because of its tall and slim profile which will fit nicely into my camper without taking up too much space let's get started I drilled two holes into the ammo box one on the top which will be the hot water inlet and the second lower down on the side which will be an outlet for the cooler water  for the valves I purchased a couple rain barrel spigots I found that they created a good seal against the tank and the nozzles were threaded which is perfect for easily connecting and disconnecting the water lines  [Music]  my plan is to run hot water into this jar where it will then drain into the tank the jar isn't necessary but I added it so that I could watch the water circulate for the water lines I used metal braided flexi hose  for the copper I bought a 40-foot 5/8 coil of soft copper from the hardware store the soft copper is easy to bend by hand without the use of tools  finally I added an aquarium water thermometer to the tank I made sure the temperature Perl rested at the bottom so that I could get a reading from the coolest part of the tank  now it was time to test my creation  after building a small fire I place the coil on top  almost immediately the hot water began to flow things were looking good that is until steam started blasting out of the top  to avoid pressure buildup I left an opening in the jar which steam was now forcing its way out of as long as there was steam the water could no longer circulate in liquid form to replenish the tank I quickly realized that my problem was in the positioning of the hot water inlet since I placed it at the top of the tank it was above the water line  so I got rid of the jar and drilled a new inlet hole higher off on the side of the tank but this time I made sure it was below the waterline now there wouldn't be any room for air to get trapped in the lines and creates steam like it had before however I left the hole at the top open to prevent pressure build-up after hooking my lines back up I place the coil back in the fire for round two  this time everything worked perfectly almost right away I could feel hot water jetting in through the upper intake valve here's what it looked like from the inside of the tank [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  within 15 to 20 minutes the upper half of the ammo box was too hot to touch the bottom of the tank registered 30 degrees Celsius or 87 degrees Fahrenheit while the top of the tank was twice as hot at 70 degrees Celsius or 155 degrees Fahrenheit  my ammo box heater operates on the method of thermal siphoning which is based on natural convection the heated water in the coil naturally rises within the tubing while the cooler more dense water sinks back into the coil where it reheats and rises again the longer the water is allowed to circulate the hotter it becomes  within 45 minutes the temperature in the tank began to equalize from top to bottom and in just under an hour the tank began to slowly boil  it was at this point that I removed the copper coil from the fire  two hours later the tank was still burning hot at approximately 70 degrees Celsius or 160 degrees Fahrenheit overall I'm extremely pleased with how efficient the ammo box heater is I still want to tweak the system a little bit to improve upon the design but I couldn't be happier with the initial results,0
288,"for the last 100 or so years when you're gonna build a house in North America you make a call to the lumberyard and they drop off a pile of sticks like this the problem with traditional framing though is everywhere you've got a stud you've got a huge inefficiency in your wall you've got a huge thermal bridge in your wall on the build show today I'm gonna show you a brand new type of framing you have never seen before today's video is sponsored by T stud let's get going  okay so first let's look at traditional lumber standard 2x6 right here what's the problem with that I've build a lot of houses out of two-by-six very strong but the problem is about 25% of our house ends up being wood and wood is not particularly good at insulating you'd never build your cooler out of wood would you this is roughly our six point eight whereas the cavity in between our 16 inch studs we're gonna put let's say in our nineteen bat in there so compared to the center this stud is very very inefficient now in today's video we're about to take a tour of this house that's been framed with this brand new product that I have never seen before this is called the T stud and this is what it looks like in the naked version what you're looking at basically is a truss you've got a 2 by 3 on both sides and it's connected structurally with dowels and then what they do is at the factory they actually use closed-cell spray foam in between there so remember that 2 by 6 that was an AR six point eight this isn't our twenty can you imagine that this is as good as that cavity without our 19 bat so now we have no need for exterior insulation that big blanket that I talked about putting on all those houses because the studs themselves are not conducting the heat through our 20 that's pretty cool all right without further ado let's go out in the house and actually show you what it looks like on a whole house framed with the T stud okay let's start here guys this is an uncomplicated part of the house we're in the bonus room above the garage and this I think is going to give you the basics on what the T stud is all about so first off they've run these on 24 inch on center marks and you can see this is that T stud this is actually five-and-a-half inches deep so the same depth as a standard two by six and then here on the front though this is where it differs we're actually two and a half inches wide on the flange so in effect it's a two by three with another two by three and then those dowel rods and you can see here they come to the jobsite in a pallet already foamed in the center but if you look at this from a wide angle you can see what I really like about the system we've got a single bottom plate right here you've got studs and 24 inch centers and then you also have a single top plate on here with the T stud as well because that T stud is a truss you've got a lot more strength and we're gonna talk to the inventor in a minute will tell us the specifics but I love how if you look at this exterior wall right here you basically have that foam that's in the center all the way down the wall and that's how they are able to get these into an AR 20 so now when we put our 19 bats in let's say on this 2 by 6 you actually have more insulation value at your studs than in your cavity which is totally different now the electrician's have just started on this house and there's also a couple of interesting things when it comes to electrical the electrician's actually just going to poke through here because there is a void and you can do that with a screwdriver and then always gonna do is stab his wire through no drill necessary now in this case we've got framing below us so they're fastening with these screws right here because we've got that two and a half inch wide bottom plate you can't use just a standard 16 penny nail you actually need at least an inch pin Edmund so you'll see they've staggered these screws and they've screwed them down now in other parts of the house where we're on concrete slab on grade they're gonna have a Jay bolt that's gonna come up in the center of this foam here and then they've got a big wide plate that's going to go on top of that so that that Jay bolt will transfer its hold down power to this bottom or pardon me to the kind of top and bottom cord so to speak on this t stud and then wear walls come together it looks like the framers framed this wall here separate from this wall that they put a strap you're gonna see that on typical standard top plate or single top plate type framed advanced framed houses and that's what they've done here they put a strap there they've also done that in this corner here where they've strapped the corner together and they frame this with it what we call a California corner so this wood right here is just gonna hold drywall up and they've done a good job of holding that back a little bit inside the corner so that insulation can go all the way back through man what a totally wild totally different system that I'm used to seeing okay this is something interesting too they've used it for headers let's look at this one first so we've got a looks like an eight-foot patio door right here no bigger than that it's actually a nine-foot patio door now we're on a gable end right here so we don't have a lot of load but look what they've used they've used tee studs for the headers as well so in effect you've got an insulated header they've run these that horizontal single top plate all the way down and then they've got three tee studs acting as a header same with these windows over here if you look at these windows over here they've got a single tee stud in the center which again is insulated that's that are 20 stud and then they basically just pack the cavity the framers said that it was actually easier to do it this way than it was to put a bunch of small cripples in there so again you've got that continuous top plate all the way across there and then here they've got their king stud and their jack stud and those two right there are helping with load as well and then these two studs that are in here they're basically just drywall nailers they're just holding it but again because it's an AR 20 they're providing insulation so now you've got an insulated structural header you can basically eliminate all of your normal lumber that you might use for headers so your LS LS your lvls all those things that we might have to build in the field and a sandwich capacity with some insulation in between you can eliminate that and you do that with the t stub pretty cool wasn't what a unique system simple yet something I've never seen before pretty wild let's go grab Jesse the Builder and see what he thinks about these hey guys I'm here with the Builder of this house Jesse Jesse thanks for having me on your job man my pleasure is this your first time using t stud oh this is not this is probably our 15th time using T studs we've been solid T studs for a little over two years now dang did you tell me earlier that your own house was the T stud house that you built that's correct about to a little over two years ago my own personal house was the first t-star house built how the first he's not house so two years later what's it been like you know as a builder the biggest difference I've noticed and come to appreciate is the fact that we've got in this freeze-thaw cycle we've got up here Minnesota yeah you tend to get your builder callbacks on your nail pops your sheetrock settling and things like that and we've seen a drastic reduction in any of those gonna call that there's one year marker when you're normally going back to fix that stuff a lot less because of this what do you attribute to that do you think for us I think it's it's got to be the stability of the t stud and the thermal break in their traditional wood studs are in this climate you know you're building in the rain you're building the snow of those things just tend to dry out and they can buckle on you so for us we've just seen a lot of stability with these studs Jessie would your framer think about this either the first time or now 15 houses later yeah well we've got a couple different framing crews and like anything in this industry guys move a little slower and so the first time they saw this there was definitely some swear words but by the second or third house they were jumping at the bit to get to another T stud house and they've really come to appreciate the the differences in the framing the lightness of the walls and so they're actually able to speed frame ax T stud houses a little bit quicker than they can do a traditional house because of the less weight that's kind of cool less wood framing two feet on center versus 16 on center single top plate so yeah they can stand up longer walls with less guys I hadn't thought about that you got a single top plate to sue now that walls a little lighter because you've got a little less weight overall two foot centers single top plate that's cool now tell me about Calvo you know when we get a typical SPF framing package let's say there's at least you know 5% of those thuds that go back to the lumberyard or in the trash or coming from blocking what's your what's your waste factor on these with the T studs you know we're probably looking at less than 1% rarely do we send one back and if we do get a little bit of twist in there then we just end up it either using it for a cripple onto our window or something like that so okay so very little waste that's cool hey guys I'm here with the inventor of the teesta Brian Iverson now Brannon know people watching this video at this point are thinking can this really replace a 2 by 6 for its structural value what would you say to that I can tell you that it's we're actually four times a 2x6 no matter if they're made out of lvl or LSL all feel they call this the x-axis they all fail in the x-axis because they Bend out a deflection if you get too much of a load on it because we're pressuring down that's that's wanting to curve out basically exactly so because we turned the board's perpendicular we stopped the ability of the board to deflect under a load in that x-axis anymore so that was the only way we fail is just like a tree standing in the forest it we want the weight to go straight down so we actually go take the weight all the way down so we're actually certified to hold eight thousand six hundred pounds versus only about 2,200 pounds for a 2x6 and about 900 pounds for a two-by-four Wow quite a bit stronger Bryan that's pretty cool yeah I can admit it was impressive a two-footer held thirty thirty six thousand pounds oh my gosh that's crazy yeah Bryan when I look around the house I don't see that there's any color difference between bottom plates and studs are you selling pressure-treated or how we keeping termites rot that kind of thing happening at the bottom plates we're going to start treating all of our products with next-gen so it's a four in one solution rot mold fire and termite all in one so you'll have the option to buy them with all treated or just the plain tea studs by themselves so you can actually get a Class A rated T stud is that right that's right now Bryan tell me about options this is the tea said they used here which is basically like a two by six replacement what are the other options we could buy from you okay so this we call this the Barenaked tea stud so it's the same frame if you're gonna do spray foam in the cavity you can spray us in in the in the field itself so that so frame the house with the naked tea stud no insulation in already so this is in the wall correct and this is your demo to show that right so here's your sheathing on the outside the tea stud now is here and so then you could spray from the bottom plate let's say from your slab spray in between and continuous from the slab all the way to the roof line right correct and you run put the Barenaked tea studs in run all your lectric old wiring security system whatever you want to run through so you can run everything you want to through there and then spray foam us and in the so you can either do you know one two three inches or all five and a quarter inches of foam whatever however you want to see that and that way you have solved for almost all of your transitions of where you could potentially have air leaks coming into that cavity plus if you've got two pounds spray foam that you're spraying that with you're adding a ton of structure right you I've seen tests before with with two inches of closed cell foam and just half-inch sheeting where a two by four shot out of a hundred mile an hour can and will bounce off so my guess is you're gonna add a lot of hurricane tornado resistant to the house as well if you did this method so we're already hurricane compliant and seismic compliant by ourselves with just this t stud this T stud we know that we're gonna be able to pass all the hurricane testing without the sheathing on that's pretty amazing and then tell me about this guy right here we actually did the boston passive house conference and they have asked us for an hour 30 t stud because they want to get rid of all the staggered stud walls dang so this is an AR 30 version our thirty place basically a two by eight where we are equal in strength to a two by eight in a wall up to 16 feet tall with that but we only have five inches of fiber wow that's pretty cool in our value thirty so we actually heated up that wood member to 200 degrees and we had no transfer to the other side after eight hours wow that's pretty neat so that's that's sick it's impressive Brian I got to say I've never heard of this before thoroughly intriguing so for people watching this video whether you're someone who's about to build a house or a builder how do we buy this how do we get all your product you have a couple of options you can have your lumber yard contact us and we'll set them up as a stocking dealer right away okay if there's nobody stocking in the area we will bundle up whatever that you need to have and we're going to ship it to you direct just have a forklift there to pick it off and so we'll ship directly out of Canada I don't or we'll send partial loads to the lumberyard we'll do whatever it takes to get the tea stones out there that's pretty cool so how do people contact you Brian what's the best way to get a hold of you guys sales at T stud comm the letter T then stud calm calm he stud calm Fred and can you guys help builders out there let's say if I've got a house coming up in two months I'm gonna pour a slab for can you guys help do the takeoffs if I've got a traditionally framed a house and convert that to a two sub takeoff yeah well we'll do those right away we'll actually try to half ways try to compare ourselves to a 2x6 or whatever yet you were going to do especially when it comes to you value calculations or the average r-value we can show you the U value through this for those of you are educated you value for this is 0.03 to 3 Brian last question I know people are gonna be asking cost tell me about let's say a standard 2500 square-foot house what's the Delta how much more are we gonna pay for a t stud compared to traditional number okay so the average house in North America 2500 square feet so we're a thousand to fifteen hundred dollars extra versus a two by six Wow so the more complex the house obviously the more costs to have involved we have a couple of 2,800 square foot two-story houses going right now full basement walkouts they're extremely complex ten-foot on the main floor second floor nine feet tall and we're 5,000 extra and that's the retail price today that's amazing and then there's gonna be some deduct right I mean my guess is with an are twenty stud you're probably gonna use less of a heating and cooling system you may you may be able to forego the geothermal that you might have might have wanted for efficiency because now you really don't need it you could use more standard let's say vrf equipment you're gonna get fantastic air tightness when you couple this with a Huber zip system on the exterior right because we've got a really tight envelope it's impressive stuff guys thanks Brian for having me out for sponsoring today's video what an incredible trip from Texas up here to Minnesota to see what these guys are doing check out TC calm if you're not familiar with my videos we've got new content every Tuesday and every Friday hit that subscribe button below otherwise follow

207,"(upbeat music) - So for the next month, I'm going to be training like the actors we see in super hero movies do. - I always wanted to train like Chris Evans. Something about his shoulders makes him so unique, that dorito shape shoulder to waist ratio. - My favorite super hero on the screen is definitely Black Widow. Great butt, toned abs, most of it is the legs. - When I look at these characters in the movie like Captain America, Thor, Superman, Batman. Rarely you get to see Asian characters that are powerful, reliable. I feel like there is not enough representation of Asian super hero figures. - So we're going to be training with a professional personal trainer. He has trained a lot of celebrities. He gave Chris Evans the super hero body. And now he plays Captain America and looks absolutely incredible. - Me, as Korean, really want to see if I have what it takes to achieve the super hero look. - I think I'm ready to look super buff. - Hi, I'm Steve Zim, and I'm the owner of A Tighter U fitness studio in Culver City, California. I've written three best-selling fitness books, and I'm going to train Kelsey and Evan like their favorite super heroes. - You personally trained Chris Evans. You showed me a before and after picture, and his shoulders just got like 10 inches wider. I want that dorito ratio. (laughter) That's what they call it! - We're going to do a five day a week plan. You're going to work out with me minimum one hour with weights, and then depending on our body fat situation, how much cardio. With Kelsey, Kelsey is starting at a really good spot. But we're talking super hero. Her shoulders are rolled way forward. You have to have everything standing up straight, looking great. And then the other part is we have to make sure she is even. I don't want one arm bigger than the other arm. We need to make everything symmetrical. The back of her leg, we want to separate the hamstring from the glute. Really important for a woman to have that. It almost looks like a bow from a bow and arrow the back to the leg. Evan looks a lot like Chris when he started. Slender, good shape, and if you look at him, he looks fantastic. We're going to take him from looking great to looking unreal. I've created a program for him to round out his shoulders, so we can really separate his shoulders out from his arms. That's going to give us what he calls the dorito look. - It was very interesting to see all these numbers that represent my body. Like the size of my sweater, and the size of my pants, that's literally all I know about my body size. - I found out Evan only had to do 20 minutes of cardio, and I had to do essentially double or triple the cardio he had to do. Women carry more body fat than men. That's just how we function on our bodies. - We use two products. We take these before our workout, and then after our workout. Their basically protein. It helps enhance muscle fiber, and melatonin helps you go to sleep. The deeper we sleep, the more growth hormone naturally is created in our system, which helps us keeping us lean, getting us stronger. This is what we do. I look at what we start with, I break it down. And then I create the exercise program that's going to make them pop on film. - First week was just awful. I was waking up before the sun was up. - I never wake up at six a.m. in the morning for anything. It was uhhh, it was just uh God. - A lot of his exercises are very different from what I've been doing. There's a lot of twisting, squeezing, and holding. Like the first day of training, he gave me a five pound dumbbell. He instructed me to do this one exercise where I bring my arm back and twist. I've never felt that weak in my life. - It's not about the weight. I don't care how much you're lifting. The weight is so secondary. It's technique, it's isolation, and it's about not swinging the weights. It's about bringing the weights. - I was really surprised how many butt exercises there are. I had never really done anything for my butt. - The first week just had so much pain involved. - And I was sore every single day. (laughter) And it was a different body part on rotations. - My abs were screaming for help. I couldn't take off my shirt because my shoulders were hurting so bad. - I couldn't walk up the stairs to get to my desk. - The first week is always a big shock because your body doesn't know what's going to happen. - Yep, this is going to be harder than I thought. - When's my cheat day? - When you're telling me we have four or five weeks to get you in shape, we don't have time for a cheat day. - I had to change my diet too, and I think that was the thing I struggled with the most. - The nutrition program I've put these guys on feeds the muscle, starves the fat. The idea is you have to get enough calories to feed the muscle from the work we're doing. Make sure that we're not eating sugar and a lot of carbs that will feed the fat because we don't have the time to do that. We want to just shred these guys up. - My friends wanted to go out for pizza, or wanted to go out for pasta, and those are all things I can't have. And I hate being the person that's picky. - I ate approximately 7,000 Greek yogurts and 3,000 chicken breasts and salmon. - Now that I'm used to this diet, every time I eat something I can taste how much sugar or how much sodium something has. - We asked him if we could eat In and Out, and he said we could essentially just eat a patty and lettuce. - Which is fine by me because that's what I eat anyways. - It was not fine by me, so I bailed and ate cheese. Like my body, I can feel the dairy. That was really eye-opening for me. All of the sudden I had to think about every ingredient that was put into anything I ate. And I realized that I had never before seriously thought about what I consumed ever. - It's eight a.m. on Thanksgiving Day, sigh. At least there's no traffic. Throughout the weeks, I was seeing changes in my body. My biceps were showing a little bit, my abs were showing. - I remember the first time I had my friend take a photo of me, and I noticed all these muscles in my back that had never been there before. It was really cool to be like, having these random muscles. - And I never realized abs were so hard to get, like one mistake or one off-track, your abs are gone. - Good. (laughter) Boom. - It's getting easier to wake up in the mornings, managing the food is getting easier. The trick might be just to like, just to keep going until it becomes habit. It's a little bit addicting, working out. I see how that is a thing now. (techno music) The day of the last weigh-in, I honestly really wasn't looking forward to being weighed again. I didn't want to judge myself and think, oh, I could have done better. But I think that how Steve did it was really great, in that it was more about the progress, and being proud of the work that we did. - I was actually really excited to find out how much I changed. Kelsey and Steve were making all of these faces after they saw the measurements. I was like is that a good thing or a bad thing? - We'll start with Kelsey. We built your shoulders up. By having that, you might gain a little width, but what that allows us to do is have a nice taper down. The chest, I kind of figured this. You were a 34, you're still a 34. - Yeah, boobs still boobs. - And the thighs, they were uneven. Now you are completely symmetrical in your legs. Symmetry, we hit it. Weight, 123. Nine pounds down. But that's not the important one, it's the body fat. And that's what gives the difference in the appearance. 20.3, 6.2 percent down. That is insane. - [Kelsey] My result was much better than I expected. I was so excited, and it was a lot of change. It was really cool to know that all this hard work really did stuff. - Okay, Evan. Number one part of the dorito, your around. You went to 48.5. 4.5 inches wider up top. - Wow. - Chest ended up at 39.25. Now here's an interesting thing. His waist started at 30. I didn't think he had anywhere to go down. He went down an inch and a half. - He's a dorito! - He created the V. We thought there was maybe not that much body fat to lose, but apparently we did. So the legs are symmetrical, but here come the biceps. Now he's at 13.75. The body fat ended up at 6.6. - [Kelsey] Yeah. - So you're telling me I lost weight, but gained a lot of muscles here and there. - Yeah. - You lost all the fat, and then gained all the muscle. - That's so interesting. - This was only a one month thing. I still don't have raging abs or like giant biceps, but I think I'm off to a really good start to transform further and better, and that's the whole point. - It really makes you feel alive to feel your body and get to know your body. I still think I'm going to use a lot of this in my day-to-day life in a less intense aspect. - I have a lot , a lot of respect. All the Hollywood stars, all the personal trainers. Their clients who are working really hard towards their dream body. - Going through, even just a small fraction of what they go through is absolutely insane. And all the pressure because you are going to be seen by people looking this way at that date no matter what. Just hat's off to those people that have that drive. - They don't wake up like that. They put in so much effort, time, and energy. There's no way of cheating in your life. - Forget those infomercials, go out and work out hard. Do it the right way. - Hey Evan! Wait, it's really close. - I'm going to eat it. - Okay. (crunching) I'm proud of you. (laughter)",0
49,hi this is Janet Jan tastic studios and I'm going to show you today how to iron a nap paper napkin onto a surface like a Christmas card now the napkins are like three ply so I've just pulled off one fly and it looks like it's ready to glue but it's not you've got to get that second layer off and it's and it's really difficult to get it to separate but once you figure out how to get it separated like get a corner work flues it's not too bad but it's just getting that finding that little edge that will release the paper and as you see I'm not having much luck here  finding a corner sometimes ironing it a bit will help it separate  I think it's kind of important to see these things because I don't want you get frustrated when you try it because you can't get it to work instantaneously there it goes okay so and as I said it'll look on the package of the McNabb khun's and it'll tell you how many ply it is that way you know how many pieces you have to take apart so there's the two plies over there and here's my third ply right here which is where the artwork is now your saran wrap has to be larger than the area one of the reasons why is the saran wrap will shrink as it heats like shrink wrap so I want to place this I want some of this really pretty border here and I'm gonna place this right at the top edge of my Christmas card and I want that I do want I do want a bit of that ribbon in there so I'm going to move this over as much of that ribbon as I can get and still get a border the bottom of the carve the tree goes past the bottom of the card but that's okay it's just going to have to have to be that way because that's the size of the card I'm using but I've got the idea and what I want in there I'm aligning it again to the top of the card to make sure everything is aligned correctly then you place a piece of paper now I tried a heavier card stock at one point thinking oh I'll do that because it'll be easier to pick up and down no the heat there's not enough heat going through the card stock to work so you need to use just like typing paper deal where you're gonna probably scorch it so this piece of paper is gonna go away now this is laying on top we're done of the saran wrap is peeking out from underneath the paper so I'm not gonna get the saran wrap on my iron of course you should use an iron that's for crafting right like we all have nine irons laying around not so I just use my regular iron as you can see by the scratches on the surface of the iron it's done other things besides iron closed in fact I very rarely iron closed ever so now I've got it on the high setting and dry you don't want steam you want dry and then you're just going to apply the heat from the iron onto the card how much heat well that's kind of iffy depending on the iron and depending on the paper and the surface you're using you want to just get it as hot as you can without burning it basically and like I said you'll probably scorch it eventually because you're going to want to get enough stick them from the saran wrap to get all the edges sealed so now my iron has done the flashing thing where you've had your iron down to long duct and so I have to lift it up to put it back down again I want to make sure I get these corners done really really good so that I have all the glue I need under these corners again holding the iron down as long as I I can hear that no you can't but I can you see it squirts right there but I could I can hear the plastic crinkling underneath it now now you see I got scorch marks there okay so now we're gonna do our first check and you also can smell just a bit of it okay so see okay that didn't stick down there you can see it coming up with it lift it from this side okay now you see how the edge is coming up just a little bit there it's coming up there it's not coming up there it's coming up there so I need to get those three corners done give it a little more heat  trying to get those corner edges just really sealed tight it's not a perfect dart it's not like is if you're using Elmer's glue the only problem with using Elmer's glue or glue to stick this down you end up with a really hard surface that looks like that stuck that looks like that stuck that stuck that stuck okay turn the iron off and then the next thing is you're going to trim around the edges now when I did the envelope which you sell I'm sure you saw my facebook page when I did the envelope I did the whole envelope with the look with the flat closed then I went back with an exacto knife blade and  cut the slit where the flap met the card and it worked perfectly absolutely perfectly okay so now I'm going to let's see if it worked I got a little bit of an edge there  let's see if I can peel it off up from over here there we go and when I  trim the top edge of my car after the plastic this is the melted saran wrap basically you're getting off of there and I saw where this edge is see it's coming up just a tad so I'm going to lay the paper back down over here and even though the iron's off it's still got enough heat probably to seal that little edge there can I think it's important for you to see that not everything there you go now the edge is sealed it's important to see that not everything is perfect and it doesn't always work perfect every dime you've got to work with it and play with it nobody's perfect okay so okay now you see the card is bent up a bit you can just make sure all the Saran wraps off then really irritates me when cards don't fold correctly so make sure your card is folded correctly and then you can take that still warm iron iron the fold kind of like a bone folder and then kind of hold it down a little bit while it cools once it cools there's your card now is that gorgeous or what awesome thanks for watching,0
366,[Music] and they ran I was here there were no other cars going so I'm assuming you still ride [Music]  thank you I'll be right back  if I do smell something do you want me to ask her about it right like now or okay I'm just making sure I'm still enough to you I don't want to do anything without excuse me man up you come over here for me real quick  you okay is there anything inside the vehicle that we need to know about meaning myself and another officer got the scent of marijuana coming from your car oh my god there's no marijuana in my car I smoke cigars smoke cigars  the consent to search yeah okay marijuana my car I smoke cigars okay yeah all right just we're just making sure I'm gonna get along I don't know who you are we  go ahead call your lawyer ma'am just try and stay in the vehicle okay  man if you consent to search okay first that's fine you're being recorded right now okay I need you to leave your purse in the color step out of the vehicle  and not on you sir back up I am I am not I'm not on you I am not in your space sir ma'am you've hit any tree tonight oh my god maybe in Turkey you find my lawyer this is ridiculous okay when you when you sign have you

license registration on him I know what this is about  okay I'm sorry  and I'm right [Music] why is there something wrong okay the well the registration that you have affixed to the window here expired the 10th of May oh I got a new one okay got a new one the clerk you can check with the clerk it's free its renewed I forgot to put it on there okay the reason why I appreciate being honest about the phone the reason why I pulled over is because when you passed me you were doing 43 in the 30 that's 13 miles per hour over the speed limit on Ulster I have enough when we were passing a firehouse I understand well let me just tell you  I understand just that Avenue is always like people are always passing each other especially at the time of day we try to slow motorists I understand I know I understand here Oh  everything is  you know I work for the county okay now any government I'm gonna County Legislator I'm going to meet the possible okay if you have the old one that's fine I can run the same number  oh you're not going to give me a ticket are you I haven't decided yet I mean I haven't decided yeah I just want this looking for the documents there's here's my card okay okay it's no reason to cry well it's my job okay just a driver's license and do you have the registration for vehicle you can have your car back there  okay to find the registration for me I appreciate it  ma'am I mean the longer though it's the longer you're going to be here that's that's the insurance do you have the registration card it should be a little yellow card all right this one's like that one was expired in 2011 if you find the registration card just hold it out the window and I'll come get it okay  everybody but if it's over the okay  easy  you want to sit down video right here and the whole conversation been recorded here too like I said the reason why I pulled you over was because you were going 43 into 30 which was 13 over okay that was every car I couldn't do slower that's that was your words okay I had 243 and a 30 which was 13 over you did admit to me that you're on your phone talking to your son I know I was on speakerphone okay  okay you're you're doing  [Music]  right can I explain this to you Jay is on the phone with the sheriff right now we're gonna have a conversation about it I'd like to I'd like to record this in front of the sheriff I want to hear all right would you like me explain this to you I want you to explain to chip money  what you're doing it's correct here we go I'm gonna here's your license back okay how much are you charging me I'm not charging anything  this license expired I want him to explain it in front of you because he pulled me over I was going the same pace as all the other cars and I feel like given what's going on with this thing with the sheriff this week I can't I don't know if I can trust law enforcement I need a witness  [Music]  can I explain this I could say please okay is everybody listening I can explain it you could just calm down for one minute I can explain everything to you and then I'll give you as much opportunity to speak to me as possible but you haven't stopped talking so I can explain everything to you explain to you anything about the ticket yet man this is the first time I've ever encountered you okay about you okay the reason why I pulled you over like I said was going 43 into 30 that was 13 miles per hour over to Sue's team okay I've got to this point four times now and I have been able to get past that point because you're interrupts I just would like to explain the ticket to you and then you'll be more I'll be more than happy because even though everyone was going at the same speed you had to single somebody out now I did not know so not my word that's what you said before them everything has been taped recorded I said I can't pull everyone over that's how the police do it that's safe we'd only pull one just choose one particular person one particular car that's going over the speed limit speed limit I was trying to keep the traffic alright can I explain this to you please guys I don't consider it I don't feel safe anymore 3 I copy everything's being audio and video recorded man ok you don't feel safe around ok well I was going to explain to you that the reason why I pulled you over was for the speed and I was cutting you a break and not issuing you for the speeding ticket if you can see here it says the new license and registration I did an issue for that ma'am you have a valid license and valid registration you just didn't present that to me the expired ones in the window and you present to me an expired license but I was able to check that on the computer to see that they were both valid  everybody's listening right now the reason why I pulled you over was for the speed I was cutting you a break and issuing you for no seatbelt I'm aware that you were wearing your seatbelt but this is a non-moving violation it doesn't occur any points and it doesn't affect your drive home are you understanding what I'm saying to you I could get points I pulled you over for the speed I could have my insurance changed correct convicted would be four points on your license so I was cutting you a break and not issuing you in support because this is incorrect charge ok that's fine I will go back and I'm going to issue the speeding ticket and not give you the seat belt  Patrick  here's the ticket that I pulled you over for it was speed and zone like I said I got to go I have a copy of the original one that you brought to me because that was already printed out so it's on the record okay that's right this is what I know this is a ticket this is what I originally pulled you over for with speed and zone for speed originally printed okay that was for a seat belt but that's not what you wanted you said you wanted which was speed and zone which is forty three and a thirty okay that's what the tickets for all right I made the ticket returnable for June fourteenth and five o'clock okay you can make your plea you can you can make your plea of guilty or not guilty on the backside of the ticket here and you can send it in to this address by this date  do you have any questions ma'am  okay well it's it's my discretion on which ticket that I issue this is what I should the other one okay but this is what I pulled you over for I didn't pull you over for seat belt pulled over for speed so it's my discretion if I want to issue the seat belt or the speed and understand what you were doing and you went back to get me the other I've been trying to explain this very nicely so you for a half hour now no I said well they didn't understand no you didn't say that you didn't understand we specifically told me that's not what I pulled over for so I said I would kindly go back and issue the ticket why I pulled you over and that's what I'm doing okay all right so this is a speeding ticket for forty three and a thirty when I originally pulled over for it's returnable for the fourteenth at five o'clock saying you kindly went back say that you kindly went back this is the appropriate hold over for I'm not arguing with you question you said that you very kindly would Mack to give me something brushed I've been kind through the whole time since I asking you to be kind and I think that I've explained and  that's no I said I kindly went back would you kindly go back and explain to me this is a ticket that I'm issuing it depends on whether you plead guilty or not guilty I will plead not guilty but I don't think what you did was you didn't excite I mean unfortunate I mean that that's your opinion if you know I would like you to be corrected so there's that's the ticket okay I can't afford this okay I wish I you know what I already lost that job it was a job so now what I will do is all just are you going to take the ticket or you're not going to take I don't really know what my rights are would you tell me let's let's just stay here and you can tell me what my rights are because they did rights were that if I didn't understand the previous ticket you would make a harsher one okay but this isn't a horseshoe one man this is the appropriate second the reason is because what you explained to me before was that the other one would let me off with fewer what I didn't understand that can you explain it to me give it then you said to me that that's not the ticket the reason why I pulled you over so I went back and I issued the appropriate ticket for you this is the appropriate ticket I pulled you over for okay explained everything to you if you want to take again you can plead not guilty we can discuss your well what's the previous one that you have explained everything to you or didn't understand about 30 minutes of just landing let's see I've already missed my job interview now I'm asking I have other stuff that I need you to put in the tax explained everything to you to the best of my ability you did yes I didn't I'm not gonna argue with you any further if you have any further questions you can plead not guilty and we can discuss it in court okay you be there if you choose to play not guilty yeah because I'd really like to discuss we did not  you can request that when you go to court wait you can request it I've been standing here explaining everything to explain what the previous one meant and I didn't okay have a good day ma'am  [Music]  alright drop it on this side okay where are you coming from 27 competent  that's what happened that's all you have is the bike

Louis des your birth date is 827 60 I sir it was a moment packed with emotion the end of a legal battle for Miami Dade County Commissioner Jose Pepe Diaz who was charged with DUI after he was pulled over for speeding on his horley in Key West back in 2015 now inside the courtroom Diaz embraced his family in fact he even walked across the courtroom so he could shake the hand of the arresting officer this is not easy and it's a lot of stress on your family your friends constituents and everybody else but I believed in that was innocent prosecutors spent two days trying to prove to jurors that Diaz was drunk in the video Diaz admitted he had had two drinks earlier at a pool party  but he insisted he wasn't over the limit after officers pulled him over for doing 74 in a 30 mile per hour zone mr. Diaz  but his defense fired back telling jurors that mr. Diaz is overweight and no one not even a professional athlete could have completed those tests without error I'm not proud of those a lot of those moments but I've learned from them and I will do with that [Music]  [Music]  the right lane their reasons why II couldn't maintain delay any medical conditions diabetes anything like that no no okay do you have anything to drink tonight no why we're making that wine tonight no it's open though when did he first open in the vehicle for what reason  it was just open for what reason was it open that's it okay all right give me one second all right stick with it you know you cannot have moving container  [Music]  okay okay all right  [Music]  hey hit the subscribe button I appreciate it take care  you,0
440,"okay team we literally have 20 minutes yeah first off why is your favorite movie we've covered this you know today we didn't talk about it but I just want to get the accent now oh my favorite well yesterday we were talking about snatch that's one of my favorite movies but actually Fight Club is one of my older favorite movies that's what crossed with mayhem was actually named after his Fight Club so yeah you know Project Mayhem crossed with mayhem that's right so he came from  Preston did not come up with any my cousin Preston tries to take credit for it but he didn't it was me in there so when we were younger Darren who's the head coach here the winningest coach in CrossFit Games History Month you know besides Chang his oldest brother and myself were best friends and so our favorite movie at the time was Fight Club and then when he passed away we kinda did it as a tribute to him so that's why it's CrossFit man like so I was blown away yesterday when he did his accent I thought there was someone else different in the room so this is from snatch okay take it away which what a which which clip do you want me to just anyone with no swearing you're like thanks you like Dex Oh dogs yeah I like eggs English words into American what is chopped chopped put it into a sentence chop something you eat or is that when you're mad I don't know put in a sentence I'm really chuffed off what's a cuppa a copper yeah put it into a sentence oh I want to I want to cover yeah okay okay okay say it in English copper cup up nah not good McAdoo yes the napkin ba growl bog bog roll chin wag chin wag you should shave your chin wag  and that is all for the English actually I so I heard Jake one of our friends invited you guys back for a fourth of July yeah and he didn't understand why you guys didn't celebrate fourth of July  he's like wait you guys don't suck no no it's kind of an American thing Kristen sure if you want to have some fun ask him about his worst CrossFit Games event many think it was the rope climb that cost him the 2010 games but it was actually his walking triple three it was pretty embarrassing I've had a couple different embarrassing moments at the CrossFit Games let's be honest there was in 2011 ernÃµ 2010 the rope rope climb obviously 2011 I actually walked on the beach sand run it really was doing great through the first half the second run crushed me it's soft sand was awful twelve I don't think I had any major hiccups 13 was pretty pretty good and then 14 love the walking on triple 3 yeah that wasn't me stuff like four times yeah or more but there the thing is I still beat some other guys walking were you trying to keep with kelipah that's why I heard the story was he went hot on the Dublin driving well I mean he's such a good rower I mean I knew I couldn't like keep up with him on the row on double honours I don't think it would be that big of an issue I mean I I was I was spent I was went out too hot on the run and then was it was super hot that day and it was either pass out or walk until I decided to walk some other people the next year on Murph decided to pass out and then your games is ruined so it was it was hot it was certain it was like your like pavement godless about going through that workout it was so and I was like it is actually wearing black nano fives Air Force of course so trying to run him that it was before actually I like working with Chris he said in triple three it significantly put you down the leaderboard this ultimately led to a pivotal conversation with Hillary later in the weekend this conversation proves without question that Hillary is the person in charge of the relationship that was actually in 13 that didn't go with that it was in 13 when Jason won I did Terra won that was another embarrassing moment at the games of pool that did awful in that event it was like 27 at 27th in that event Jason did pretty well he won the both rows and then he won the burden run and so after that I was in like a 200 point hole I think I was in fourth or third or something like that I was just being a baby I feel sorry for myself and we're sitting in the back then we're in the stadium at StubHub and Hillary came down in the athlete area and we're just sitting there talking and I was just being a baby and she looks at me and she goes well if you're not having fun let's just go home I was like what are you talking about she said she goes just tell Dave get your stuff just tell Dave you're leaving I was like yeah I'm gonna tell Dave that I'm leaving the CrossFit Games just cuz I'm not having fun and so she's like well you better just start having fun then so there we go starting around from there does she wear the trousers most most of the time yes yeah I'm not gonna lie we've seen it a little bit yeah what was your first car ever my first car ever was in the Zuzu hombre so is it basically it's an s10 so a Chevy s10 small truck small pickup truck it was actually like we call me to meet her man trucks so like people that go check the electrical meters on this it had an actual sticker that was removed so remove some of the paint I actually learned how to drive on a 69 c10 pickup truck and that's why I thought my first truck was gonna be but it was that subtle tantrum yeah in some country so you've done a lot right you've been all over the world yep with this water boys what is left on your bucket list what do you want to do is there something you don't mind that you're like oh yeah I do want to go to Australia yeah there's got to be something that you're like you're like ah before maybe my career is done or after my career there's something that I really want to dive into it I just do it all right just pretty content children I like where we're at I would like to race a car yeah like goes some driving school or something like that yeah we were talking yesterday and Edinboro is one of the coolest places that I've been and I want to go back where I actually have some time I mean I as bad as it sounds I like being at home you know I get to hang out with these guys and I'm kind of a homebody I do enjoy getting once I get to places I like being there but getting there's the you know the airport and all that stuff that's the that's the hard part of it what's the best piece of advice that you've been given first what something this stuck with you over these years of being the top dog what was the what someone told you something in you in yep that's it my grandfather or my dad I mean I don't think you know words for me are just words usually I think it's more like seeing how hard my parents work both my mom and my dad my grandparents as well all of my family so just I'm not really a I'm not a motivational quote guy I don't you know I don't look into that stuff too much I just its lead by example and that's you know kind of the way I was brought up that was the leadership style Mike both of my parents had and so that's this is the the leadership style that I have it's not really know if there's ever really one piece of advice that's been given other than just a whole collection of you know actions by my parents lead by example has been one thing that I've seen since you've been here yeah that's why we're doing the workout so you always finish personal you're always go in that chair the whole team are still working and you just sit there in the chair hey watch the person who's watching that's pretty cool do you use emojis I was when you message us I don't get an emoji I don't know if you like me or debuts yes I don't really use emojis the American flag and the eagle and sometimes the middle finger are the only yes are the emoji said I use I think that was happy with that yes yeah yeah so I I speak in gifts usually though what is your go-to track like you're like you need to get pumped up you've got a 5 minute workout you want a 5 minute track what do you what is rich Froning good upon um I mean everybody knows that that when they watch our videos they're kind of like you guys listen to worship music for me  fierce by Christian stanphill it's a it's a Christian song but it really it gives me fired up gets you out ya know set of fires also another good one are you a good cook I can grill yeah tears come around to your house and so wait what do you cook us steak some sweet potato fries can you nail sweet potato fries because the majority of let's get them soggy well well you've got a greaseless deep fryer well it's a airfryer's that's where it's at next time you come do you have a jack do I have a joke no another phone gave I've always told us about the pig one oh yeah what kind of what kind of I'm very kind of bread we're kind of bread the pigs eat wheat wheat [Laughter] such a day I love dad jokes two elephants koala form alright no reaction  I've seen it for myself over the over the last couple days but what's your usual training light because for me it just seems like you're in the hall there yeah yeah he's because your barn is right like it Barney yeah it's the house yeah I mean we can work out pretty much whenever we want so it's nice um yeah I mean throughout the week it's usually we meet up team meets up about 9:00 9:30 we may start with some type of interval we may start with swim or whatever it is and then usually work out till about 12:00 12:30 1:00 o'clock ish break for an hour or two and then trying to get about 3:30 or so it's like a full workday yeah pretty much pretty much we're using it for time with Roman stuff do you get stopped stripped by people or is this someone that you want to meet um you know I I'd love to meet the rock I would love to meet the rock yeah that would be a corn to meet I grew up my childhood hero was Barry Sanders we actually have a fat head of him in our office and I would like to meet him what baby in a second I'm almost done yeah we need the time this is this is all the time so literally all the time what he's not working out this is Iseman where's the five minutes go see what Dan is doing real quick and I'll be ready you're stranded on a desert island with two Games athletes who do you choose apart from Dan Bailey and Josh bridges is Facundo you know for kundo right okay so he does this all the time this is his game and we joked that if you had jason khalipa he would somehow come up with a way to sell the bananas or coconuts to the monkeys or whoever is on the island to make some type of business out of it so but no I mean me Josh josh is obviously a no-brainer bridges cuz means ex-navy seal you want somebody like that good for comedic relief most of the time yeah trying to think of another one Ames athlete that I don't know you guys a survival with skills yeah I mean you guys do come from Australia but one event you could go back and do real in swim I wanted this one event with the pool because I did so terrible on it that I am wait a much better shot yeah someone still bothers me do you eat pizza oh yeah Oh Pizza yeah you do do you have pineapple on your pizza I don't mind pineapple on my pizza only have it not regularly no that's not that's not my like that's not like my first choice but I would eat it do you get nervous you want those people not like I guess it's compared you know when you go into competition and like a lot of people just get nervous before you go into competition do you get those nerves or you go on the floor for sure yeah how detailed every detail with them I think you just kind of use it you channel it and use it for what to make you go harder make you go faster I mean if you didn't you know every time I get out there I'm like why do I do this this feeling's awful but then you know in the middle of it you enjoy it and at the end of it you're glad you did it but man yeah super nervous we haven't gone three times when you doubted yourself yeah all the time every time almost every of that you're like man I can I hold whatever pace I think I'm gonna hold you know it's so-and-so gonna go faster yeah so I mean yeah you're gonna there's gonna be some doubt that creeps in there but you just kind of deal with it and push through it okay so you head you know when you do an event like some people like me I think when I'm going through the yeah some people say they died oh yeah for sure there's always always some type of for me is you know everybody kind of says why I just you know I still get my own head and I you know try to do my my thing and don't worry about everybody else but I think you have to worry about everybody else and you have to watch everybody else and I think that's where the sport comes in to to play is you have to kind of you know if you know so in somebody's better at something or certain movement you know you don't wanna let them get too far ahead can you catch them on the next thing or they are they going out too hard can you see them sir suffer a little bit you do know can they keep that pace there's a lot of things going on in my head usually when you know it's a little bit different now on team you're kind of watching your teammates more than you're watching everybody else but you're still kind of taken you got to step back a little bit and be present enough to know what's going on I mean if you're true competitor and you want to one win you've got to do those things you love the avenges I love the adventure so if you could be one of the Avengers which one would you be oh man I'd guide man Iron Man yeah I mean obviously Captain America would be a good one he dies off in there he does die you know so yeah I'm getting old so you know that's I don't know if it's confirmed it's in all the leaks so maybe they you know maybe they threw that leak out there for you too yeah Captain America I did really like this last thor ragnarok and Thorpe became pretty cool in that one before that was like a Thor's alright but now I'm like it was pretty cool so that's good yeah just to let you guys know rich Froning does not play pokemon go I do not play but he is excited for the Pokemon movie I do kind of watch it right well that's fine dude you know a good movie I think checking you would ever make a movie apart from the movie that you've already made but like from that movie if the Avengers came to you as head absolutely we won't be in the Avengers I would love to yeah of course that would be cool idea anything I mean growing up I always wanted to play professional baseball like that was my my thing now it's like there's so much travel involved in that that would be tough I mean any professional sport I would love to do hockey I really enjoyed playing hockey the last couple years that we we started playing hockey yeah something like some sport yeah I just um I grew up you know I told story all-time I'm one of 32 first cousins on my mom side and 25 of us her boy so it was just competition constantly and so I think I have to do something where I compete what's the worst job you've ever had uh had some badge I was an exterminator so like I crawled in under houses and sprayed for bugs I did that when I was a firefighter on my off days with one of the guys that was my lieutenant or here's my engineer I did that I washed and waxed houseboats which sounds like a great job because you're at the lake all the time but it's terrible because everybody's going out to have fun you're washing and waxing houseboats it was terrible but yeah exterminator wasn't the most fun job I ever did what's the funniest thing that's happened to you at the games come on let's go to be story there is one we were rowing the half marathon in 13 Zack forced and this I tweeted this a couple years ago his AK force at me and we're rowing and we kind of like lock eyes awkwardly and he goes think about pancakes that's what I'm doing it was like that's better than what the hell we're doing right now because it was awful but yeah it's funny I don't know why that was so funny to me at the time when I was like I needed that yeah so it was good pancakes that's what I'm doing are you happy that you didn't do the marathon right yeah you know we we were talking about that actually this last week and I have where the full marathon roll would be terrible but the half marathon road that we did with the two case sprint I think is worse because you had to go so hard because especially for me not doing well on that first event I had I had to sell out on that that 2k and then having to suffer through a half marathon after that was so daunting and miserable cuz you're just so uncomfortable and you can't like you know what you finished a 2k for like a PR 2k if you want to roll off the rover and like ride and paint you had to keep pulling on that rope what was your TK time six uh first thing that comes to your mind right now say it  couch what's the most amazing thing that you've done and then you've like looked up and look around and no one's ever noticed it yeah I've had babies mom we're talking about yeah now dad reflexes like you know everybody talks about that like trikes one day was walking out to the barn and there's only one mud puddle the entire way there and I'm like now there's no way sure enough he walked right to it slips and I catch him like by the shirt before he falls flat on this mud pole and I'm like that was awesome and nobody saw such a letdown you're just like wow I'm the badass and then you're like I know you're like yo right nothing so you know air rifles are now they're like I guess it's like the first offenders come over with a girl in it yep yeah what do you think about that do you like it are you a fan it's an airsoft rifle like it shoots plastic pellets so it's fine I think so yeah I know people are gonna say that it promotes violence but it's an airsoft pistol like it's not gonna be I'm glad they did a biathlon cause innocent pretty much an explorer right people like yeah yeah yeah yeah how can you argue that I mean they do it in the Olympics so yeah and you are gonna go individual row but in the classic the legend and the legend lasers of that that's the game plan right now as long as health health permitting yes that's the game point I've seen I've seen your life and it's like people are always you know like the article came out like the joke article that then I picked up on as it gets the views yeah oh yeah  you know like it everyone's like oh you know finished 10th in the open which is super impressed laughter you know like thank you you you're not like you're not going out there to win the open you're just doing it like you don't you didn't even have to do it to do it yeah but you just did it anyway like everything one and done I redid the handstand one because it was it wasn't that terrible and I knew I needed to go fast from the handstand walk it was more almost like I should go faster let me redo this one so just a lot of people are saying like oh why doesn't he come back and do individual you know and go against Madol and I look at it from the point of like you've done your thing and now you like when you look around and when you're at the barn like it's so fun to see you interacting with your your family right kids and set up and I think a lot of people maybe don't understand some do yeah I think you know like part of it is to like physically I feel like yeah I can hop back out there and still be competitive but there's something there just like after the five years of competing as an individual and doing the individual thing for so long that you just like I step back from it and the the mental like the the kill switch like I don't I don't have to feel like I need to do that anymore you know like that I don't have that where I want to go out and win the CrossFit Games as an individual and so if I'm physically the same as somebody else if they have that extra little switch obviously gonna win because I get an open workouts and I'm like I should push right here your election as bad I wish I had that feeling I'm not yeah and I can't it's just for me I feel like it actually be a disservice to competing to know that you know if I went out there I don't have that same push that somebody else has that should be their that they have that push I don't know just for me it's it's not I guess now you get that push from the people around you from the team yeah like I will I'll do whatever I'd have to or whatever I can for my teammates but for myself I'm like you know it is what it is you know it's I don't have that anymore I don't I'm not going out there to get third or top ten like I would if I'm going across there games as an individual I'm going to win yeah and so I wake up every day as an individual my goal was to win the CrossFit Games now when I wake up every day my goal is to be at that yeah and so it's different you know his priorities are different so but you still have a lot of training in there I still and I in but I love what I do and I and I get to train hard and I still get to compete and and fulfill that side of my life but it's not when I'm done training I don't think about training anymore like I can kind of I still at times think about training that'll be alive but it's not when I was an individual I was obsessed yeah people said I would we were talking to people last night and they were like yeah he used to just come in and bury us and then I'd be like I really have to go yeah and then he was like no you're not leaving it's pretty accurate yeah I mean I was you know in in relationships and other things like that suffered and I'm just not willing to do that anymore like and I have nothing left to prove you know I don't feel like - so you play video games I'm horrible at video games I actually do have a we have a we built to one of my buddies built a chair for a steering wheel and so with the only game I actually play it's NASCAR because you can just drive and I can play that pretty well but like I'm terrible with Call of Duty or anything like that awful one piece of advice for people who are getting into CrossFit you know there's people that have new have fun yeah that's the thing everybody gets so caught up you know Pat Sherwood says there was a saying that you said you know like make it the best hour of your day CrossFit and fitness should not be an added stress even if it's not CrossFit do something like I we get so caught up and fighting about you know it's bodybuilding of the power lifting is across but I don't care do something like and make it enjoyable making a stress relief and not an added stress so many people get so caught up in oh you know I didn't and that it is good to have goals and to push and you know to have something and you know to be worked up about it but man when it's when you're done leave it leave it at the gym and have fun I'm gonna get more out that if you enjoy exactly exactly I supposed to be a stress relief not an added stress and you're bringing out coffee on you Josh is working on good dudes coffee so we'll see I'm I'm gonna have to actually start drinking coffee I guess because I don't do caffeine the only time I do caffeine is when I compete just so I have more sensitivity to it a couple years ago I quit quit doing caffeine so drink any caffeine other than competition days I miss it last one I'm never gonna have every job except for nikah this is why my fitness is not fully understand now yeah yeah kind of play it by ear a few would ask me last year I said I know year or two left and I'd be done but this year I feel great is the best I've felt in a long time health-wise as long as I feel like I'm not holding anybody back and I can still you know hold my own and be a productive member of the team I'll compete as long as as long as I keep enjoying it so I feel good right now Jeff Bridges says he wants to go team there we go no such ideas knee fixed yeah the thing working first ta said ta said once she's done with individual shorts to go team hey come on you guys get up and you know this this vlog is honest right like what is your nutrition like because I'm like this is 269 yeah well so I've you've been hanging out with me a lot when I'm doing intermittent fasting yeah and so I eat from 1 p.m. until 9 p.m. and so I have been working with RP the last couple of years and so they did have me on like a full schedule but then in August after the games you know I'd been reading some stuff on intermittent fasting how it was good for inflammation some other things and I was having so much inflammation of my knee I was like I want to give it a shot see what it does and I felt great since August so I'd do in a minute fasting that I try to work in my my food within that eight hours and so right at one o'clock is usually when you know I eat a lot and then you know throughout depending on training sessions and what we're doing then I'll leave and you do eat cookies and ice cream and things like that hey you know if it fits in there you got it it's very similar to at macros they do a lot of timing stuffing and other things it's about getting the certain numbers yes I have a template of like cert amount of protein carbs yeah that's what I'm supposed to get and they want you to get healthier stuff but hey if you got some forgot some extra carbs at the end of the day why not eat your cookie you know right you're having a joint party at your house and you can only invite one person here and that person for the night not obviously my wife you're gonna invite that's the last question you've got to spend four hours with them there's banging music there's a lot of drainage anyway okay anyone in history I mean you gotta see for me I have to say Jesus obviously but Alec Bernardi and it would be but man that's a tough one one person me that person of my wife hanging out yeah just yeah Dan I've lived and lived with me for too long love Dan oh man Shane is the same as a party Shane's a good dude to have around he's funny if you want to chat Royce is quite good at that my slice is exact conversation and this is a good conversation he can talk to you for hours I like a bunch of people I don't like a bunch of people all in one area cuz I don't like crowds but rice and Lakeland anymore kids not in the immediate future definitely not opposed to having more kids for sure we're we're good on the baby stage right now we're ready to be out of diapers for a little while but yeah I would have a fourth for sure if that's the plan if not then we're great with our three you know I was great with Lakeland and then trice came along and loved to have a try surround and now we've got violet so we got it we got a party but it's awesome it's a fun party it's it's chaos look it's good yeah yeah yeah we're not definitely unopposed to doing them now especially heaven had babies for so long you like it'd be nice to start at about two or three but ya know I'm not opposed to two any age we actually had one falter that was around four and so ya know we're completely open to any any situation that fits what what we feel like God's plan for us is ya drinkin your kids will become the fist on earth I don't know I've never pushed them to I will always push them to do something physically active but I'll never push them to do you know anything if they don't want to do prosper they don't have to do CrossFit but I do want them to play some type of support or be involved in something as some part of team you know I just I feel like there's so much benefit life lessons learned in one in sports through competition but to in working with people and being on a team you know some of those things I can't replace you know growing up like some of my best mentors remind baseball coaches and some of my best friends were my teammates so can't replace that and you look great so like I was jealous no yeah I was like oh okay great good Bogey's dirtbikes yeah and he loads of land yeah would hate water gosh what a Josh so Josh just is like he's just a big kid with a lot of money I think is what he said it's like Disneyland is ya know we have

time it's been a fast one now we get to the airport there port yeah",0
282,"Sherman tanks remembered by their designers for speed and agility and by their crews for being the right tanks for the wrong war [Music] how many times have you seen images like this from film shot during World War two  powerful American Sherman tanks rolling across the European countryside delivering firepower to Allied ground troops where it was needed most the Sherman tanks weight class was somewhere between a light tank which was small and a heavy tank was a big monster it was designed to go over military bridges it was designed to fit on railroad cars it was designed for easy transportation it was designed for automotive reliability when the decision was made to invade Europe General George S Patton himself selected the Sherman as his tank of choice he said we don't need a heavy tank we can win the war with this medium tank make as many of those as you can Sherman tanks rolled off American assembly lines by the thousands nearly 50,000 total when they reached Europe three to five man tank crews immediately took them into battle the image of the approaching Sherman's became a myth like representation of the invincibility of America's war machine  but those who actually fought it and maintained the Sherman tanks claimed the invincibility was a myth and as far as their design for World War two is concerned the tanks were engineering disasters [Music] Milton Cooper served as a captain on a Sherman tank maintenance unit in the American 3rd Armored Division he recounted his experiences in a book titled death traps Cooper vividly remembers the first time he approached a disabled Sherman tank  the first shot had gone through the transmission and in addition to the forces robbing the transmission is going through a five inch steel driveshaft and that stopped the tank the second shot went hit the top of the turret and cut a three-inch grew through about three inches Rama in the blast killed a tank gunner when I saw that I thought this tank had just had to protect you know and then after that they started bringing tanks in droves with the dead and wounded inside and it was as terrible and I knew then that we had an inferior tank  we had short-barrel guns designed to shoot high-explosive shells at a fairly low speed mm fee a second the German guns would shoot a solid shot at 3,500 feet per second that meant that they had to three times the penetrating power of our armor-piercing shells and so they went through our tanks like a hot knife through butter the Sherman's may have had the speed and mobility so highly regarded by Patton but those were not the qualities needed to fight the larger German tiger and Panther tanks the statistics from Belton Cooper's unit speak for themselves we lost 648 tanks totally destroyed in combat another 700 knocked out and repaired and put back in action that's thirteen hundred and forty eight tanks knocked out in combat says five hundred eighty percent loss I don't think anybody took that kind of loss in the world Army Navy Air Force submarines method like that in one unit they sent 18 of these newly crewed tanks into combat and in the first 20 minutes 17 of them are lost it was murder [Music]  it really was almost criminal what our forces had to put up with because we didn't have the right tanks  why were the Sherman's so vulnerable for starters their offensive power was hindered by inadequate weaponry I have a letter and I filed that came from General Eisenhower and he wrote directly to general Rhodes and he said general Rhodes I know you've been losing a lot of tanks I'd like to have you ask your crew and your tank commanders and your combat commanders why are we losing so many Sherman tanks in the best answer he gave was by a tank gunner who said general in order to knock out a German tank I've got to get that 600 yards and catch it on the flank they could knock me out of 2,000 yards head over for all practical purposes a Sherman could successfully battle the German tank  from just one direction the only way our tanks could defeat their tanks is if we could run around behind them and shoot him the rear end where there wasn't much armor we did that but typically it would take five tanks being blown up before the sixth one got around to shoot a German tank at the back the mathematics were not good when it became clear to American tank commanders that their Magnificent war machines were so vulnerable they resorted to makeshift methods that would add defensive capabilities and length to their lives anything that they could gather that they can put on that faceplate to protect it they put logs they put steel plate they put chicken wire backed up with points and concrete in the faceplate anything that could get on that to get my threat of survival but for the most part any effort to improve the Sherman's was futile to make matters worse Sherman's required highly flammable high-octane gasoline their engines were originally designed for airplanes in every decision that was made in the development and use of the Sherman from beginning to end they had to make choices between options okay we need a high powered engine with light weight okay we use this engine it's an aviation engine it burns more flammable fuel but power is the most important thing power and weight or we need a tank that can move very fast to exploit a breakthrough so we can't have real heavy armor because that would slow it down we'll have just enough armor for what we think we need the job of a Sherman tank maintenance engineer was a grizzly one we had to clean the tanks out it's a terrible job to clean out a tank with the head shot off in the arms and legs dismembered it's just awful and we had to put them in inside the tanks to get the bodies out and wrap them up in a tarp and then it would put him outside and that the tank crews knew that when they got in that tank he went to battle if they got hit they would go be in bad shape their tanks were knocked out and sent back to repair and then they came back and they got into a tank that had just been freshly painted to cover over the bloodstains that had obvious patches in it from where the mechanics had plugged the holes they knew what they were going up against they knew they were outclassed they knew that if they ran up against a tiger or a Panther tank they were in a lot of trouble we were just inadequate that's all I can say we just did not understand what we were doing that's a great tragedy",0

not least got a lifeline lifeline looks like this lifeline seven feet long if you fall out the raft we can throw it to you if you're at 8 feet I should just should get to 7 that's the only way we can get you back in um with that being said have a good time enjoy yourself so I turn around everybody buckling and stuff up they putting the helmets on as I hey y'all look you know before we go do this I just want to tell y'all fuck this for all this time I'm not gonna do it yeah I'm serious I'm not bullshit she talking about if I'm at 8 feet I better get the seven no no no bitch you better get they okay hey hey personal shit started to come out all my life they've been telling you I couldn't reach it without you small now you telling me you can't reach me I crave it I'll break it down right nothing hey yo yo man get stuff together let's do it I was like fine you know what I ain't me you gonna set up front since you're so damn tough now man I ain't be getting in front of the rain right we're here my wife is here my boy maid is here Lance is alway in the back now for those people don't know whitewater rafting is it's really dangerous like the water is going like 40 50 miles per hour you're like a pinball in a pinball machine every time you hit a rock ping you bounce off that's all that's all so we're in the water but we're not doing bad we're doing good we're doing pretty damn good we going oh it's fun scary but it's fun we hit a rock bounce off I turn around I don't see 90 no more here's one my closest friend so now I'm scared I'm worried right oh shit where's Amen I turn around names foot is caught on the clamp on the side of the rat and we're dragging him but he's so scared he not blinking he's just looking to me heck good so he was I pulled me up man pulled me up pull me up now I couldn't pull him up cuz I was laughing my yoga you ever get that laugh where you get that cramp like y'all somebody's I put me I can't man I got a cramp I pull really I'm serious

back I'm not doing this shit no more I'm gonna do it you me not doing this the more you made me do it we're gonna finish no I'm serious we start arguing Lancers in the back cuz i yo y'all better focus cuz hellhole is coming up hell hole is a waterfall that's probably like from that balcony to the floor right then go straight down the only way you get out of hell hole you gotta ride the way you don't ride the wave you get stuck in the middle they got to come and chopper you out cuz all the water gets a flood raster they gotta get you out right I'm having so much fun I start talking shit I'm so small where I can lean on the front of the Rev like a hood ornament I was like fuck hell hole I didn't want to do top tanning I wanted to be original oh so lazy I'm serious focus y'all focus we go down hell hole Lancers like everybody paddle paddle paddle we all start paddling as hard as we could it did not look like we were gonna make it outside the hell hole so we all lock eyes at the same time everybody jumped out the raft we all jump it I saved myself I didn't give a fuck about nobody my wife nobody I got to a rock I turned around I saw my wife doing some weird kind of doggy paddle trying to get to me but when I saw her I didn't want her to see me see her cause then she would want me to get back in the water and go get her I wasn't gonna do it so I turned around this way like I never saw her she's like Kevin hey where are you you gotta be a part of your own rescue you gotta help me help you she's like thank you I understanding right now she finally got to the rock this is the second time that I left somebody for dead and they survived well once again it was an awkward moment I didn't know what to say I was like hey look who made herself a swimmer up top give me some bring it in she did one here none of that shit right so she gets on a rock naked on the rock Lance is like a Marine he got his paddle in his mouth his casts out the water he doing the doggy paddle we went on he gets on a rock I'm like okay where's my II say my best friend I'm worried right now I don't know what the thing cuz my friend isn't here I'm like Lance where my friend at he like yo don't worry he's underwater he'll pop up hey wait with you what you mean he'll pop up like he he gonna pop up dead he's the well if he is we can bring him back the woods wait what what do you mean we're bring him back man go we gotta go get him on cue now ain't pops up right he's so afraid when he pops up that he's not moving his hand he's looking straight ahead he's got his life vest in his paddle like this and he's just looking straight ahead and blinking he's blinking a whole fucking like that's how he was scared this is the rock sweetie like right where you are that's when I ain't miss I'm like yo turn on your stomach get to the rock I know he hear me cuz he's blinking but I'm like I hope he's not trying to give me like a more as cold as some shit like that because I don't know Moriscos right so I'm like y'all turn his stomach it's in rock this asshole keeps floating past the damn rock I'm looking at him he's looking at me blinking like shit I'm like what are you doing he start waving his pad oh and air breeze my waving his paddle in the air cuz he want somebody to grab his paddle and pull him up I'm not tall enough to grab his paddle I'm not even about to attempt to reach out and fall so I give meaning the same predicament as him I didn't want that problem so Nate was like throwing the lifeline I was like what if we needed let him deal with this situation so he's going down the middle of the raft right he's now doing this with his panel in the middle of the river going back and forth cuz he wants me to grab him pull him in there and like I said we're the only black people there all the other white fans over there I like semi-pros they do this all the time they're like professionals some parents were like using their kids as paddles they were doing tricks like it was serious I'm real serious now name is a Muslim here's why I tell his story he's a Muslim he'd been a Muslim his whole life a serious Muslim like not a half-assed Muslim like he one of them Muslims that read the back of packets you know talking about like like hey man you want to start bursting let me see the packet give it to me mm-hmm read that look that's pork right there I told you man sport he one of them Muslims right this why I tell his story he's in the middle of the river waving his paddle back and forth this white guy is going right towards him the white guy smacked his paddle out the way move man you messing up the trail I saw this with my own eyes move you messed up the trail man not a m-- without hesitation he was like Jesus please help he didn't even ask Allah for help hit him he went straight to Christianity he was like I'm not the time wait you rat man he's like Jesus come out I told him he's a phony you should eat a pork salad to kill himself immediately Hey y'all have been a great crowd man thank you all I appreciate,0
328,"of all of the spaces we visit perhaps none capture the imagination more than a treehouse today we've traveled to Seattle Washington to meet Nelson treehouse and supply and see one of their incredible new projects [Music]  hey Garrett hey awesome to meet you mate glad you can make it welcome me too dude what can I even say about the treehouse this is so impressive pretty cool huh Nelson treehouse and supply was founded by Pete Nelson you might also know him from the TV show treehouse masters on Animal Planet Pete has been building treehouses for 40 plus years he's built over 250 treehouses and in 2010 he started Nelson treehouse and supply and basically we traveled the world building luxury liveable voice function fully furnished treehouses so tell me a little bit about the construction of this thing because this doesn't look like the sort of thing that you just throw together on your back yeah there is some pretty heavy hardware that's holding this thing up isn't there yeah so the whole treehouse is fully engineered we have our treehouse attachment bolt that basically holds the whole thing together it is 18 pounds of heat treated steel bolt right into the tree steel yoke holding two steel beams it sounds there could be an earthquake and a windstorm in this thing is not going anywhere this is definitely really well attached but the question that I have to ask is how does this actually affect the tree I mean they look quite invasive in there don't they we get that question so often and the way a tree grows is all the nutrients flows through the cambium layer which is the thin layer between the bark and the actual inside of the tree so when you install this tab basically you're making a three-inch circle and the cambium layer so really that just triggers reaction wood and makes the tree grow around the tab and makes the connection even stronger over time one of the other really unique things about this sit-up is it's actually not just attached to one tree it's actually fixed to two so how do you get around that challenge the tree house is engineered with a static tree and a dynamic tree so basically everything is bolted onto this tree and the whole platform treehouse will move with this tree that tree on the other hand is dynamic you can see up there our connection is using dynamic uplift arrestor ease that allows the tree to move in the wind and slide around and keeps the bolts intact and keeps the treehouse from getting any damage so it's kind of like you figure out which you want to be static and you figure out which tree you want to move and you engineer the tree house to kind of be dynamic and move with the forces of nature so how do these tree houses actually cope with the growth of the tree you're only going to see growth outward so you don't need to worry so much as trees growing different rates or you know this tree is going to grow five feet in this tree is going to go three because they're kind of grown from their tips and not so much at the base so the tabs really stay where you put them and that's where they're going to live and it's good to see as well that you've also utilized the space underneath the tree house yeah so this is a Kodama zone and I mean what better way to hang a swinging chair than from the bottom of the tree house that's actually one of the really cool things about tree houses as well because all of the land underneath is actually still understood isn't it right yeah so you're basically taking the foundation of the house and you know lifting it in this case 14 17 feet off the ground so there's still kind of like a ground ecosystem that can exist under the tree house well enough of being on the ground let's get in the tree yeah what setup I'll show you around okay so we have a curved stair set outfitted with natural cedar branch railing kind of a code to the treehouse life style this tree house is like 80% built from cedar you know yeah cedar stair tread cedar decking cedar siding cedar railings I mean we have a lot of cedar here in Washington and it's great because cedar is actually weather resistant so it can stand for years out in rainstorms and it's never going to rot which especially when you're this high up is really employed right yeah you don't want to fall through the floorboards definitely not right and what a great space you've got up here having especially this balcony area it really allows the house to take advantage of its location doesn't it right well I mean a big thing about having a tree house is being able to be next to the tree and so it's pretty important that every tree house has a deck and like I said we get a lot of rain so the sleeping loft actually acts as a canopy for the table here and we have a curved hog wire paneled railing here so it adds kind of a nice natural detail and one of the other things I notice obviously the treehouse itself is quite squared but you do have a lot of features that are curved in this as well kind of hiking back to the tree right right around yeah I mean it's definitely somewhat more of a modern treehouse we have a lot of 90 corners and lines and you know I think it's complemented pretty cool with the curse they're set in the curved deck and it kind of just creates that contrast between like new and modern and back to nature can we have a look inside yeah that's what we came for let's go check it out welcome to the treehouse this is really cool standing in here it feels very much like I'm actually in a normal house it's incredibly stable and it's not until I actually look out the windows that I realized yes I'm actually standing in the treehouse right now yeah I think that's a big thing about tiny living and treehouse living is that you know you want to feel at home you don't want to feel like you're living in a plastic box and so you know all the wood and the smell and the structure just really makes you feel at home so when you're actually building a treehouse to what extent does the tree dictate what you're able to do with the structure that you're building on it you're definitely confined to X amount of space because you have to build off the trees so in the design phase you know you're looking at where does this branch go where does that branch go and so you kind of build the structure to fit within the trees and so that actually drives a lot of the design processes this tree house really does look like it has been built so it could be lived in full time yeah I mean that's definitely an option we wanted to keep open just because no one losing it now doesn't mean someone can move in later and I think the place is designed with that in mind you know is that like you got your kitchen and your reading nook in your loft and it's like it has all the things at least for an extended stay at minimum so we've got the kitchen over here then yep the kitchen space for a little mini fridge you have a toaster oven and a microwave it's actually kind of impressive what they managed to sit in this little space and I say you've got to pull out table here as well yeah yeah this is just will pull out table made from some of the reclaimed materials at the end of the project and good to be resourceful yeah easy to transform the space from you know entertainment living room area so more of like a dining room table if you want to cook dinner or something and is that it close up behind you this yeah yeah this is a closet it's actually kind of built into the structure there's some beam's that cantilever out the side of the street house and this whole kind of nook was built around having a closet here so some extra storage space and just like these bins down here under the the reading nook you know those pull out and give extra storage and what's out this tool whew I'm glad you asked we have an outdoor shower kind of cool oh no way yep what better way to get in touch with nature than literally reaching out and grabbing a tree branch while you're taking a shower I'll say showering and the canopy what could you ask cool it's hard to beat man it's really hard to be kind of a complemented with this corrugated siding it creates privacy and still really allows you to feel like you're outside and then up here still to go we've got the sleeping area yeah yeah so you know there's a whole queen bed up here right above the entryway that you walk in and you access it via this kind of cool rustic ladder why don't we head up and take a look let's do it oh this is so nice up here there's a lot of people who don't really like the idea of a sleeping loft because of accessibility issues but I think if accessibility is not a problem then it's definitely a more efficient use of the space I mean this whole area is deceivingly large you know you come up the ladder and you almost feel like you're in a separate room there's this aesthetic about it that like you've almost entered into like a zone you know that's totally different from the space below and with a treehouse like this of course you have to have skylight yeah skylights I mean you can lay in bed and literally look right up at the canopy of the tree there's even like enough room to stand up and from up here there's a great view of the rest of the house as well right I mean it feels spacious you know for such a small space this is a really functional home but being a treehouse of this nature there's also a ton of engineering that's gone into it what kind of cost would you be looking at to build something like this with a custom steel substructure fully engineered material cost labor cost you're probably looking at about $150,000 so it's not super cheap but when you think about everything that's going into it it's not super expensive either is it right I mean it's essentially a fully functioning home but 17 feet off the ground so a big part of that is the labor and the steel substructure and the engineering and all the thought that goes in to making it safe so when you talk about that there is obviously this real engineering factor to building treehouses is there a big DIY element do people actually go out and build these themselves or do you guys not recommend that yeah we've actually recently with the whole tiny house movement seen a whole lot of desire from people to do DIY builds and we actually sell the hardware to people online all the time and we have multiple videos that instruct people how to install our hardware so I'd say that is definitely becoming more and more trending as the scene kind of expands we really do want to give the power to the people and give them the opportunity if they can't afford 150 thousand dollar house they can go and DIY it so what would you say your absolute favorite thing about treehouses is I'd say immediately what comes to mind is to escape from reality you know you open up the front door and you walk in and you're kind of just like totally taken aback from all your world troubles and you're just like taken back down to Ground Zero and basically just become a kid again so that stress-free feeling that is I think so important ever since I was a kid I have been obsessed with tree houses and getting to walk into this space until this home is an absolute dream come true for me thank you so much for sharing it with me going - pleasure to meet you ma'am thanks man I think this home proves that treehouses are not just for kids yeah it's adventurous yet maybe a little bit crazy but when you think about all the engineering that's gone into it this is an incredibly safe and sturdy home perfectly well-suited to full-time living and if it were up to me I'd be moving in tomorrow [Music] you",0
0,"Translator: Salma Anwar Auditor: Anwar Dafa-Alla We see with our own eyes But we see with our minds too A vision in the mind is often called imagination We compose the scenes of our imagination Our inner fantasies. We lived with them all our lives But there is also something called hallucination And hallucinations are completely different It does not seem to be our own making It does not appear under our control It seems like I come from outside of us And it seems as though it mocks our awareness So I will talk about hallucinations And a specific type of visual hallucination It is a type I see among my patients A few months ago, I got a phone call From a home for the elderly I work in They told me that one of the residents there, an old lady in her nineties, She was seeing things And they asked if she was mad !! Or is it because sheâ€™s old, She may have a stroke or Alzheimer's disease So they asked me if I could come to see Rosalie It is the name of the old lady So I went to see her It was immediately evident She was completely sane Clear minded and very smart But she was scared and confused Because she was seeing things Then she told me And the nurses didn't mention this She was blind She was completely blind, as a result of macular degeneration of the retina, five years ago But now, in the past few days, she has seen things So I asked her, ""Things like what?"" And she said, ""I see people in oriental clothes, ""In droppings, they go up and down the stairs."" ""And a man turns towards me and smiles."" ""But his teeth were huge on one side of his mouth."" ""And animals also"" ""I see a white building. The sky is raining snow, light snow."" ""I see a saddle horse, the snow pulls away."" Then one evening, the scene changed. ""So I see cats and dogs heading towards me."" ""They come to a specific point and then they stop."" Then the scene changes again. ""I see many children climb up and down stairs."" ""They wear bright, blue and pink colors."" Like oriental clothes. ""Sometimes,"" Rosalie said, ""before people showed up in the picture."" Pink and blue squares were placed on the floor, Which looks like it extends to the ceiling So I said to her, Is she like a dream? And she said, ""No, it\'s not like a dream. It\'s like a movie."" She said, ""It has colors, and there is movement."" ""But she is completely silent, like a silent movie."" She was closer to a boring movie She said ""All these people are in oriental clothes"" ""Ascending and descending, very frequent, very limited"" (Laughter) Really her soul is fun. She knew she was preparing. But she was scared. She lived 95 years, You have never seen hallucinations before. She said that these settings were unconnected Whatever you think, feel, or do. It would come and go without a reason. She had no control over her. She did not recognize Any of the people or places That appear in the configurations. And any of the people or animals, Well, they were all oblivious to her, not seeing her. She did not know what was happening to her. And she asked if she was on the way to madness. Or she is losing her mind. So, I checked it carefully. She was a bright, smart old lady. She was completely rational and did not have any medical problems. She was not taking any medication that could cause these hallucinations. But she was blind. Then I told her, ""I think I know what happened to you."" I said ""there is a special kind of visual hallucination"" That may accompany deterioration of vision or blindness It was originally described. Back in the Eighteenth Century ""By a man named Charles Bonnet"" ""And you have Charles Bonnet syndrome."" There is nothing wrong with your brain or mind ""You have Charles Bonnet syndrome"" How comfortable you are when you hear that There was nothing dangerous about it She was also curious I asked ""Who is Charles Bonnet this?"" She said, ""Did he also have hallucinations?"" Then she said ""Tell all the nurses."" ""It is what I have is Charles Bonnet syndrome"" (Laughter) ""I\'m not crazy. I don\'t have dementia. I have Charles Bonnet syndrome."" I did this and told the nurses Now this - for me - is a familiar situation. I work a lot for the elderly. I see many elderly people They are either hard of hearing or visually impaired. About 10% of the hearing impaired Musical hallucinations. And about 10% of the visually impaired Optical hallucinations. It is not necessary to be completely blind, Just poor enough eyesight. And now with the original description in the eighteenth century, Charles Bonnet did not see her. But his grandfather was seeing such hallucinations. His grandfather was a judge, an old man. He had undergone Cataract surgery. And his eyesight was greatly weakened. In 1759 he described his grandson Multiple things he could see. And the first thing he said he saw .. A tissue is hanging in the air. It was a large blue handkerchief Four orange circles. He knew it was a hallucination. There are no tissues flying in the air. Then he saw a big wheel hanging in the air. But sometimes he was not sure whether he was prepared for him or not. Because the settings were in line with reality In the context of what he sees On one occasion, while visiting his granddaughters He said ""Who are these handsome young men who are with you?"" They said, ""Grandpa !!, there are no handsome guys."" The handsome young men disappeared And it is expected from these preparations To come in a flash and disappear in a flash They do not come and go gradually. They are often sudden, and they change suddenly. Charles Lolland, grandpa He saw hundreds of different shapes, Different views of all types. On one occasion, he saw a man in the apron, smoking a pipe, Then I realize that this person is the same. And this was the only form he got to know. On another occasion he walks through the streets of Paris. He saw (and what he saw was real) scaffolding. When he returned home, he saw a microcosm of these scaffolding He is 6 inches tall on his desk. This repetition in observation and perception Sometimes it is called (Pananopsia). In his case and in the case of Rosalie .. That happens with them - What Rosalie asked, ""What is happening?"" And I said that while I was blind, Whereas, the areas of vision in the brain are no longer connected to any inputs These areas become overactive and stimulated And they start shooting automatically So you start seeing things And the things you see can really be very complicated With one of my other patients .. And she was also seen in a simple way The hallucinations you see were somewhat annoying. On one occasion she said she was seeing A man wears a striped shirt in a restaurant He turns to her. Then.. The man split into six bodies wearing striped shirts And they start in the direction towards it Then the six bodies, like the accordion, overlap. And once, while she was driving .. Or rather, her husband drives the car The road was divided into four .. And she felt as if she was going in four ways at the same time Her hallucinations were also very mobile And a lot of it has to do with the car. Sometimes she saw a teenage boy Sitting on the hood He was very holding and was moving gracefully, When the car veers. Then when they stopped, The boy suddenly rises vertically to 100 feet in the air Then it disappears. Another patient of mine was suffering from another type of hallucination It was a woman who did not have any problems in her eyes But the problem was in the areas of vision in the brain. Small tumor in the cortex of the back of the brain. More importantly, she was seeing cartoons And those drawings are transparent It covers half of the field of view, as if it were a display. And she was seeing in particular, Kermit the Frog (Laughter) I do not watch (Sesame Street) But she noticed her saying .. ""Why Keremet?"" She said, ""Kermit the Frog is nothing to me."" You know, I was wondering about Freud's determinants Why Kermit? ""Kermit the Frog is nothing for me."" She did not care much about animation But what really bothered her was that she was hitting her .. Hallucinations and urgent pictures of faces .. As with Rosalie, the faces were deformed With very big teeth and very big eyes They scared her. So what happens with these patients? As a doctor I have to try and define what is going on. And to reassure people I especially assure them that they are not crazy As I said close to 10%, Those with low vision become hallucinations But barely 1% of those admit it. Because they are afraid that they will be seen as crazy or something Even if they mention it to their own physicians They can misdiagnose Especially since the general concept is that if you see Or hear ears, then you're on your way to madness. But hallucinations (psychological) are different. Psychotic hallucinations, whether visual or vocal She addresses you and accuses you. Seduce or insult you Cynic from you. And you interact with it. And that characteristic of orientation and self-discourse does not exist In the hallucination of Charles Bonnet syndrome. It's like a movie. You see a movie that has absolutely nothing to do with you. Or this is how patients describe him. There is also a rare disease called temporal lobe epilepsy. Sometimes when an individual develops this disease, The individual may feel that he is moving back To a time and place in the past So you see yourself at a certain crossroads. Or smell the smell of roasting Abu Farwa. You may hear road congestion sounds. All senses involved. Here you are waiting for your girl. On that Tuesday night in 1982 Hallucinogenic hallucinations It is a hallucination that affects all senses Full of feeling, full of intimacy, Exist in a place and time, Interconnected, dramatic. Charles Bonnier's hallucinations are not. So in Hallus Charles Bonnet, You have all levels .. From hallucinations to geometric shapes, Like the blue and pink squares that Rosalie saw. Even heavily detailed configurations For objects, especially for faces. Faces, sometimes distorted faces, It is the most common thing In those hallucinations The second most common of them is animation. So what is going on? It's great that in the past few years, It became possible to perform brain function imaging, Functioning of magnetic resonance brain imaging, during hallucinations In fact, he found different parts From the brain's visual part, it is activated, While they were hallucinated. When someone sees hallucinations of simple geometric shapes The primary cortex is activated It is the part of the brain for receiving patterns and edges Pictures do not form in the primary cortex And when the images are formed, A higher portion of the cerebral cortex is involved. It is found in the temporal lobe Specifically, in one area of â€‹â€‹the temporal lobe It is called fusiform gyrus. It is known that if there is damage to the fusiform gyrus of one of them, It can lose the ability to recognize faces. But if there is abnormal activity in the fusiform gyrus, They can see hallucinations of faces. This is what we see exactly in many previous cases. And there is an area on the front of this gyrus, Where it represents the teeth and eyes And this part of the gyrus is active, When patients see these distorted hallucinations. There is another part of the brain, It is specifically active when See the animation It activates when we recognize and distinguish animation, When we draw them or when we hallucinate them. It is very exciting to be aware of this. And other parts of the brain are particularly involved, Absorbing hallucinations Buildings and landscapes. Around 1970 it was found that not only parts of the brain are involved, But also specific cells. Facial recognition cells, for example, were discovered around 1970. And now we know that there are hundreds of types Other cells. Which can be very, very specific. You may not only have cells To get to know the car, But you may have Austin Martin identification cells (Laughter) I saw Austin Martin this morning. I should have mentioned it. Now she is here somewhere. (Laughter) Now at that point, in what is called the temporal cortex, There only visual images are perceived Or phantoms or parts of photos. And in the advanced stages only Other senses begin to join And it begins to relate to memories and feelings. And in the Charles Bonnet syndrome, The patient does not reach this advanced condition You are at these levels of the underlying visual cortex Where there are thousands and tens of thousands And millions of pictures, , Or broken phantoms or fantasies All are neurologically coded In specific cells or small clusters of cells Usually all of this is part of Integrated absorption or imagination stream. The individual is not aware of it. And only when the individual is visually impaired or blind Only then is that process intercepted. Instead of receiving normal images You receive stimuli or Messy convulsive releases Of all these optical cells Found in the temporal cortex. Suddenly, you see a face. Suddenly you see a car. Suddenly this appears, and suddenly that. And the brain does what it can to organize And to give a kind of connection to all of this. But it does not succeed enough. When those cases were first described, They thought it could be interpreted and translated as dreams. But in reality the injured say, ""I don\'t recognize these people. I can\'t find any links with them."" ""Kermit doesn\'t represent anything to me."" Do not reach anywhere with their interpretation as dreams. Well, I said what I wanted to say one way or another. I think I just want to summarize And I say this is common. Think about the number of blind people. There must be hundreds of thousands of blind people Those hallucinations, But they are very afraid to mention it. So this kind of need is a must It is observed, for the sake of patients, doctors, and for the public. Finally, I think it is Never so interesting and valuable To give the individual some insight into how the brain works. Charles Bonnet said 250 years ago And wondered how those hallucinations Or, he said, the theater of the mind Brain machines can be produced by them. And now, after 250 years, I think we're starting to look into how this happens. Thank you so much (clap) That was awesome. Thank you very much. You talk about those things with great acumen And sympathy for your patients. Have you ever tested such syndromes that you write about? I was afraid you might ask this. (Laughter) Well, yes, and a lot of them. In fact, I am relatively weak in sight. I am blind in one eye, and seeing with the other is not of sufficient quality And I see hallucinations of geometric shapes. But they stop there. And they do not bother you? Because you understand what is happening. Don't you worry? Well they don't bother me more than my tinnitus And who ignored it. Sometimes they interest me. And I have a lot of drawings for them in my books. I underwent a functional MRI scan To see how my visual cortex takes care of things. And when I see all those hexagon shapes And complicated things, which I also see, In visual migraine I wonder if everyone sees things like this And if things like cave art, or decorative arts I somehow derived from such hallucinations. This was a really cool talk. Thank you very much for sharing. thank you thank you. (clap)",0
245,"This is 30 days working out like Chris Hemsworth. So about two months ago I got very sick while traveling overseas I fell into a felt like the worst shape of my life when I fully recovered I vowed I would never take my health for granted I around this time I noticed that Chris Hemsworth my celebrity crush was about to release a fitness app called centr Hemsworth is an international movie star absolutely shredded workout monster and all-around a legendary real-life superhero his fitness app gives you access to his personal team of industry professionals who help him get into superhero shape the goal of this video is simple I'm going to be doing the workouts meal prep and meditation from the center app combined with the heavy weight training program that Chris did to see if I can get a body like Thor so for the next 30 days I'm going to workout and diet like Chris Hemsworth just gonna do a little 360 here so you can see what we're starting with definitely bring in the gut a little bit back a little bit more definition here yeah this is the starting point before we jump into this here the rules with any meaningful goal there needs to be a deadline number two no processed sugar it actually pains me to do this number three no alcohol and finally zero cheat meals stick to the diet 100% with that today is day number one I just downloaded the app now the main page here it's your daily planner and that's where it breaks down your workouts your meals and even your meditation the first workout of today is a maximum effort box and cardio challenge oh yeah I I grew up swimming and wrong so my hand-eye coordination isn't the best but that's why we're doing this get out of the comfort zone get some muscles while the expert trainers from Chris's team aren't here in this room with me they are on the app and the workouts are coming directly from his trainers so all this challenge is gonna come down to self discipline first workout has done it a lot harder than I thought I'm dripping in sweat from that now we have to wait work out the second portion of this training program is going to be mainly weightlifting I found this workout from researching on the internet what Chris did to get all ripped up for the Avengers films for Thor so the weightlifting portion is gonna be mainly compound movements with pretty heavy weight and it's broken down by body parts so today is chest day so we're doing some flat bench it's two workouts per day cardio or a functional fitness workout from the app in the morning then weights in the second session the weight training is pure bodybuilding workouts it's just time under tension to failure and of day number one my chest is already sore and my shoulders from the boxing my tired scale one to ten probably like a 9.5 I mean you can kind of see bags under the eyes and that no sleep day number two tomorrow end of week number one biggest challenge so far has been the just the workouts I'm doing workouts that I've never even heard of before and I'm soaring places that I didn't even know really existed all my body like at the hip right here is sore the inner thighs the food has been very tough seven eggs spinach typical breakfast we got some peas some broccoli some lentils and of course our best friend the chicken breast now for this challenge I'm cooking all of my own meals the meals are consisting of lots of veggies lots of good carbohydrates lots of proteins I'm consuming a calorie surplus about 4,500 calories per day based on my body weight and how you to put on muscle I'm not talking to bad calories I'm not talking a white chocolate I'm talking I'm talking to lean proteins good fats this is a typical meal but at the end of the first week I am giving absolutely crushed by the workouts although I'm starting to see a little bit of definition in my arms but I'm just grinding away putting in the work towards that end goal so it's day 15 I am at the midway point of this 30-day challenge and I feel amazing like the first week it was I feel sore I can't move this week it's like wow I've actually have some some muscle definition coming in the changes have been pretty ridiculous I'm actually very shocked my strength is up I've been recording the weights as I'm going it's amazing the increases week by week it's such a short amount of time honestly the easiest part of this has been the 5:00 a.m. wake up's 5:15 in the morning and when you have a solid reason why all your other actions like waking up at 5:00 in the morning Monday through Friday they become pretty simple they become justified it it's doing something day in and day out over and over again on those days when no one's watching when everyone's asleep warm in their beds workouts are still very hard daily discomfort that's what this is the hardest part is still the diet I am eating so much food constantly eating everyone says it but until you actually are doing it I is the hardest thing the diet will make or break a transformation or fitness goal something that I didn't expect was how much I would be relying on the meditation portion of this app start by making yourself very comfortable I have fallen asleep to that the past three nights in a row the meditation aspect especially after a long day I mean I have no complaints I am actually very blown away by how this has gone so far I'll see you in 15 days for the final reveal this is 30 days working out like Chris Hemsworth I mean as you can see like I have I have a six-pack now looking at the pictures from the star of this I don't even feel like the same person all around they feel strong I feel healthy I feel fast I feel fit that's how I would describe I feel very fit it is possible to get in shape by yourself after just 30 days I'm pretty close to being in the best shape of my life I'm able to power through these workouts compared to at the beginning of this challenge where I was sucking wind barely able to complete these workout circuits and now I'm pushing myself as far as I can go wanting more wanting more of a challenge and Chris if you are watching this I want to say a massive thank you for making this app and sharing just a little bit of what makes you successful comment down below if you're interested in seeing a 60 day follow-up video and with that I'll see you in the next video",0
203,ah scuse me is there a toilet nearby  quickly do you mine I've got it is it  nearby there's right into the green room  right into the green room  [Music]  hey what's going on everybody for first  we feast I'm Sean Evans and you're  watching hot ones it's the show with  hack questions and even hotter wings and  it's a banner day in internet history as  we open up season eight with Gordon  Ramsay he's one of the world's most  decorated and successful chefs with an  empire that includes more than a dozen  restaurants countless best-selling  cookbooks and seven hit TV shows  including MasterChef junior which  returns to Fox this February Gordon  Ramsay welcome to the show  great to see you so we started hot ones  about four years ago and shortly after  we put up our first episode we're  bombarded with requests to get Gordon  Ramsay on the show and as the show has  grown so too has that albatross around  our necks which has followed me from the  Internet to the airport to my family  get-togethers so this one is very much  for the fans  I'm nervous in a good way but at the  same time I feel like a weight has been  lifted off my shoulder so I just want to  say thank you for coming in today you're  welcome good to see you Congrats by the  way thank you very season eight amazing  and I have four kids there pay me to  come on this dad I want to see how good  your palate is or how strong your palate  is you've got a big mouth you shout and  scream all day long but can you take a  hot wing  so finally under immense pressure from  the family and a lot of supporters out  there I'm here the world has pressured  us into this room Gordon that is it if  it all goes tits up after this it  doesn't matter we may be hot ones okay  [Music]  okay so how long were these wings cook  for oh I knew that this was gonna happen  damn yeah yeah cuz a bit fucking  overcooked fly eating a mouthful of  fucking sand  [Music]  a good wing look at your arms that's a  good wing right there yeah yeah but so  it needs a bit meat on them things like  a quail so Gordon as we mentioned in  your intro MasterChef junior comes back  next month one of your many shows that  become a global phenomenon when you  think back and all the times you've been  wowed by the raw talent of a child on  that show is there a story that stands  out I think of some of the earlier kids  now you're back on season one the other  into the 18 19 year old Alexander from  season 1 and yeah this guy is a prolific  chef he's barely 19 years of age and for  the last five years he spent weekends  and holidays in some of the most amazing  restaurants across the world so I say  them no mom no dad no school teacher you  love me gonna hate me it's gonna be the  best football coach you ever met in your  life but you'll come out of this a much  better cook and they do what's been the  most disturbing thing that you've ever  seen unnoticed or uncared-for at a  restaurant and Kitchen Nightmares that's  a really good question so I went into a  refrigeration unit once and saw a tartar  sauce three and a half years out of date  how fucking dumb must you be to use this  tartar sauce that's stank to use a  source that's festering bubbling like  something out of fucking Harry Potter  that was off three years ago several  Stuart littles spotted in the corner the  kitchen yeah big motherfuckers not like  cats I didn't know they only have cats  they didn't resemble hey it was a  fucking rats  yeah pretty shocking from rats to mold  to recently come across the restaurant  with plastic cheese over nachos covered  in mold you have any idea how long  cheese needs to sit in a fridge that's  plastic cheese to get mold fucking years  yes  hippie-dippie green while they smoke you  might come up with these names probably  opium okay  hmm okay so the restaurant business is  notoriously difficult with these thin  margins and then of course infinite  space for human error and then when  you're a chef who's famous and has this  large empire that goes across several  continents you end up being a target for  the type of Yelper or TripAdvisor  comment or there's like this place is a  total ripoff I could have made it for  three dollars can you explain in  layman's terms the basic math behind how  a twenty five dollar cheeseburger might  end up on a menu mmm  I've seen chefs with freaking gold leaf  on a burger ready to get to a hundred  dollar mark which is a bit stupid really  because you don't go near a fucking  burger with gold leaf and white ain't  that flavor so twenty five dollar burger  it's all about the patty the thickness  the blend it depends on whether it's a  Chuck for the short rib a great brioche  bun and how you lay that up with here  all the trappings of a luxurious burger  is there a hidden cost and running a  restaurant that most diners are unaware  of yeah it's called rent and labor costs  two big key factors in running a  successful business  landlords they win either way so the  more successful you are the more rent  they ask for the less successful you are  the more demanding of the rent so the  great way of identifying a classy  restaurant is being full on a Monday  night Friday Saturday we'll look that'll  take care of itself naturally if you can  fill it Monday Tuesday Wednesday you'll  not depend of the way there  [Music]  fucking grapefruit in hot sauce few  series I know that you spent your early  years studying classic French technique  you're bouncing around restaurants and  London and Paris working alongside some  of the most influential chefs in the  world so at that in mind I want to  bounce some of the people some of the  mentors that helped shape Gordon Ramsay  into this battle-hardened perfectionist  that we see today and just curious what  you learned about cooking what you  learned about business maybe even what  you learned about life from each okay  we'll start with Marco Pierre White mhm  fucking phenomenon a nut buster a  ballbreaker  super talented chef if you thought my  performance sometimes was shocking in  the kitchen that was a fucking Hollywood  blockbuster right there Oscar nominated  Marc appear wine  that guy had finesse he could close his  eyes and dress a play beautifully and he  could come out looking like a Gucci  handbag  I mean stunning how about geese of what  he said what was amazing it was like  this perfect Frenchman that was your  hardest fuck on the outside and then you  look at him it's the kind of guy that  your grandma would take the fucking  bingo we had one and a half days off a  week that half a day if you took that  half day  you're fucked so he had to be in there  no pay and shown willingness you have to  learn and as an English cook enough  education I had to bust my ass off twice  as hard now yeah one of the best chefs  living today and still a prominent  figure nada cuisine how about Joel  Robuchon Robert Sean was a taskmaster  combined Marco Tony Bourdain geesa wah  Alvaro  all together and you've got durable shop  because you know and the outside world  it was this incredible successful genius  but behind the scenes oh my god you know  from raviolis flying over your head to  fucking copper pans to I used to see  ducks flying from one end of the case of  the other thinking that just reborn the  fucking wings  the only thing was missing with the  feathers I remember me telling me that  the best thing ever happened to was a  shit that ran down my mother's leg when  she gave birth to me how did you get up  in the morning concentrate and work the  next day on that one then so for all  those beautiful Millennials and  snowflakes out there trust me the more  you get pushed the thicker your skin  they're picking your skin  trust me the higher you go  [Music]  cheaver goal from where out of New  Jersey rights to a gold and you mind if  I sponsor the wings getting forwarded is  like pay for some fucking decent meat on  those that would be a dream come true  for us there's a trade emails we'll  trade emails South nippy at the  beginning is like nip nip nip  immediately so it's not a it's fine no  mm-hmm it's not super hot so with your  many best-selling cookbooks than your  how-to tutorials online you've inspired  a generation maybe several how to up  their food game but today we want to  give a lesson to the spice Lords can you  break down the perfect Gordon Ramsay at  home burger and describe how to make it  as much detail as possible yeah so for  me it's about that blend I would go  sixty ground beef ten percent fat blend  that with Tim sent Chuck and then I  would do almost like a luxurious for it  in there and then the last parts  somewhat lean so a bit of a tri-tip in  there in a way that it sort of holds  that thing together so it's tight the  cedar of great burgers in the seasoning  and so to many people make the burger  but they don't season it properly so  season this thing chili flakes garlic  powder salt pepper severe seared strong  Kara's Asian on top and then it's the  basting and so once you've caramelized  that burger on top don't worry about it  still being raw inside you baste because  as you base that the butter it seeps  through and become so much more richer  the fat camera Liza's on top of the  burgers the flavor layers beautiful  brioche bun beauty toasted and then bait  so not is it toasted but it holds  substantially all those juices the most  important thing about a burger let that  thing rest before you bite into it and  that's what happens sometimes they cook  the burger they buying a meal it's our  man it's all pissing out yeah let it  rest let it sit inside there and then  stack of usually  [Music]  so you made this one and it's out  fucking day 2017 can't you afford  fucking sourcing dates oh no I just  stage battles oh is that good yeah  bullshit here we go  so where's my nice I like that you do  yeah that's quite zesty that's that's  fruity I like that smug Serrano some  more engine there yeah I mean I'm not  too sure about apricot but big big  that's good image now it's getting  hotter you know yeah little bit is sort  of starting to move on the armpits I'm  sweating that's how we do it here Gordon  Gordon we have a recurring segment on  our show called explain that Graham  where we do a deep dive and I guess  Instagram pull interesting pictures that  need more context yes I'll bust out the  laptop I'll show you the picture so you  just tell me the bigger story does that  sound good  yes sir I do brilliant Judy's diving  people talking Instagram what's wrong  with you  do you go for another okay Gordon first  things first  do you remember this meeting of the  minds courtside at the lakers game you  David Beckham and Kobe Bryant yeah I got  absolutely fucked there really yeah  because five minutes prior to that I  threw the first ball out of the Dodger  Stadium the game was so fucking boring  DB takes place a cleansing basketball so  I went to the basket way I got into such  trouble because you can't go from  throwing the first pitch out then go and  watching the fucking basketball ten  minutes later can you well you again  yeah no not good and so yes at ringside  there it was the first time in my life  for six for two I felt like a short us  it was fucking 7-foot tall it's no  longer down there it's like shit so  loved the game and yeah Kobe one athlete  Jesus incredible do you remember this  lunch service at Downing Street with  Tony Blair and Vladimir Putin yeah I  mean quite honestly probably the first  time as a chef I still between two guys  customers actually shat myself thinking  this could go off any minute  entering down these streets getting  pelted by see if their supporters  outside they're anti-putin and anti flan  ever since that day I've never got  involved in politics right based on that  lunch  you mentioned turning one of those  leaders ill based on a funky and bad  oyster or a shit chicken wing we didn't  serve tickling his there by the way  I did the most amazing paramos to sea  bass with a computer martyr and a  beautiful shellfish vinaigrette and we  finished with a Bakewell tart so I  remember the menu you know as if it's  last week powerful lunch but couldn't  wait to get the fuck out there  [Music]  yeah okay that's hot now tingling them  again yeah in the back half here mm-hmm  yeah yeah hmm okay so we've talked a lot  about your tangible accomplishment yes  Michelin stars TV ratings yeah I'm  curious about some of the more unusual  highlights and lowlights from your life  of the following daredevil moments which  was more intense hunting down a Burmese  python butchering a wild boar are  tracking down puffins in Iceland yeah I  have to say tracking down puffins in  Iceland let me know via this is how this  country lived  yeah four four four four decades that  level of protein across those winter  months is brutal so sort of hanging off  a 600 meter high cliff with a rope and a  fucking net catching this furry bird to  eat and I made this amazing dish puck  that's hot that thing by the way shit it  started to come true now what you're  laughing at yeah it's a big deep breath  so and I made this amazing puffin salad  made this bread yeah and improved it in  this active volcano in Iceland dug the  hole stuck it in amongst these rocks  came back the next day and fucking bed  was nicked someone stole it so I'm still  looking for that Viking that stole that  fucking amazing loaf of bread bastards  [Music]  oh yeah yeah okay yeah nice moving yeah  yeah also it's just a little bit it's  not time not good that one is it it's a  tough one yeah sort of one also it's us  mm-hmm  so when people have reached their peak  in a profession whether it's Kobe Bryant  I think that's uh I feel like that  burning a new ring on my fucking ass you  and I both Gordon III on this one now I  know this song means Ring of Fire was  that Johnny Cash I won in this fuckin  seat there's nothing coming through so  we're okay  all right but everybody in production be  ready okay yeah ring a fire holy fuck  yeah asshole is somebody with a foot in  both worlds who's more insufferable TV  critics or restaurant critics the both  come from the same cloth to the both  standing staring I wish they could be  you so fuck you take on the chin chin  please you in the same pot well you know  it seems like on paper at least that you  would enjoy the linguistic flair of a  good take down so I'm curious I want to  hit you with a few infamously savage  restaurant reviews and I'm just curious  how about your ear from an insult level  before you go there I remember once the  unique standard years ago when I first  opened and this amazing food critic  described one of my dish yeah I scored  it you know shit yeah looking like toxic  scum on a stagnant pool I'm like fucking  really that's how you describe my  fucking dish toxic skull in a stagnant  pool shit did I really hurt you that  much let me bounce this one off of lace  from Jay Rayner writing for The Guardian  in 2013 he said of the muscles at Leon  de Brussels in London the meat inside  the shells is small and shriveled and  dry each shell contains what looks like  the retracted scrotum of a hairless cat  Wow so that's savage right yeah so we  can't talk about quitting's like that  but they can talk about us like that I'm  a firm believer in keeping it  professional but not personal so I had a  run-in once with a critic and  unfortunately asked him to leave but  fuck my heart's beating as well like  fucking the drum what is going on with  these fucking wings did you make this  sauce this next one is from Pete Welles  in the New York Times Guy Fieri's  restaurant in Times Square  why is one of the few things on your  menu that can be eaten without fear  regret called a roasted pork Bonnie when  it resembles that item about as much as  you resemble Emily Dickinson jesus  christ almighty a good morning glad  you've had a fucking great day I know  guy but any chef that turns around puts  a donkey sauce on his fucking menu gonna  get a kick in ok cuz if my wife was sat  there thinking sweetheart have the ribs  with the donkey sauce it doesn't quite  ring well does it you know shit happens  take it ok and shut the fuck up and then  one more at the risk of being a bit  cheeky yes Owen is from the late Sunday  Times writer a a go about your own  restaurant aubergine in the 90s the chef  is a failed sportsman who acts like an  11 year old fuck him fuck him  yeah I didn't realize coming the hot  ones I'll leave you fucking free  ourselves yeah I mean Jesus Christ nice  I have a fucking you can now put a label  on that fucking thing Jimmy huh it  haunts my dreams  yeah I mean the wings are getting  fucking smaller and smaller now they  look like my fucking granddad's no  fucking these fucking big toe how'd you  get a chicken wheel it looks like my  granddad picked oh wait till you buy  into it it tastes like your  grandfather's big toe shit yeah that's  like fucking sticking your tongue in a  fucking plate of acid mm-hmm Jesus  Christ  yes what's the fuck's gonna happen  tomorrow we're back behind the line  tasting and perfecting right the fuck  you gonna be tomorrow I mean not to  coinage shit I'll be in town I'll be in  town Gordon and you're never one to  mince words when it comes to items that  don't reach your culinary standards  whether it's your hub food that's laced  in truffle oil our tasting menus overrun  with foams but how does Gordon Ramsay  feel about some of the 2018 food trends  that have been bubbling up across social  media we'll find out today  Steven laptop please Gordon how are you  doing my man now feel like I just

I have taught you the most important skills to be a world-class artist. (laughter) I know what you are thinking. ""This is not real art, I certainly can\'t make me a world-class artist. "" So let me introduce the artist Chuck Cross. For decades, he has been ranked as one of the most profitable artists in the world, And it is precisely this technique that he uses for artistic creation. So visible that we are with The difference between the most ambitious ideals we can achieve, It â€™s not how many magical skills and talents we have, But how do we understand the problem And make decisions to solve problems. And it is precisely because of what we face everyday This continuous and complex Billions of small decisions, Even if we make minor improvements in the process, The end result can also be very different. for example, Let's take a look at Novak Djokovic's career. In 2004, When he first became a professional tennis player, He ranks 680th in the world. Until about four years later, He successfully jumped to the third throne in the world. His annual salary increased from 250,000 to 5 million, This is just a game bonus, Of course his achievements stem from winning more games. By 2011, he was already the number one male tennis player in the world. Start earning an average of 14 million match prizes per year, And win 90% of the competitions. These beautiful data The best part is: Nowak has no way to control them. He can only control those small decisions, Make the right choice, In order to indirectly affect the probability of success, Let him achieve these achievements. And we can use the percentage of the score as a reference standard To quantify and monitor his progress. Because within the rules of tennis, Winning a point requires one to three small decisions, I want to call this his decision success rate. When he won 49% of the games, He also won a score of 49%. To be the third in the world, To use a racket Earn 5 million annual salary, He just needs to make the decision success rate Raised to 52%. If he wants to be more than just the number one in the world, And become the best tennis player in history, Then he only needs to make the decision success rate Increased to 55%. I always use the word ""only needed"". I don't mean to imply that this is an easy goal, Obviously it is not. But the slight improvement I said It's something that everyone here can do easily. Let me reveal the mystery: From kindergarten until high school graduation- Yes, that's how I graduated from high schoolâ€” (laughter) Every transcript says the same thing: ""Stephen is a very intelligent young man, If only he could calm down and concentrate. "" They didn't realize, I'm actually more eager to focus than they are, But I just can't do it. As a result, I went from kindergarten to sophomore, I'm all C, C- students. But when I entered the junior year, I've had enough. I want to make a change. I want to make minor adjustments, I choose not to be a viewer of choice anymore, Instead, become an active participant. So in that year, I no longer wonder I'll suddenly know it and be able to calm down Focus on more than 5 or 10 minutes, I decided to assume that I couldn't do it. So if I want to fulfill my wish-- Outstanding academic performance- I must change my approach. So I made a slight improvement. If I need to complete an assignment, for example, reading the five chapters of a textbook, I would not imagine it as five chapters, Don't even think of it as a chapter. I will break this homework into tasks that I can complete myself, And each task only requires me to focus on 5 to 10 minutes. It's about 3 to 4 paragraphs. that's it. When I completed that 5 to 10 minute mission, I will get up. I would go to play basketball, draw, Or playing video games for a few minutes, Then I will come back. Not necessarily returning to the same assignment, Even different subjects, But it's just another 5-10 minute assignment. from that time on, Until I graduate, I am an all-A student and will be on board every semester Dean's recognition list, principal's honor list. I enrolled in the world's top Finance and Economics Graduate Course. The same method, the same effect. Then I graduated. I started thinking after taking office, This method really worked for me. That is, taking these grand ideas, These complex ideas, these huge tasks, Broken down into smaller, more controllable tasks, at the same time, Make minor adjustments to the process To increase your chances of success. I want to apply this method to my career. So I did it. At first, I was a strange financial derivatives trader at Credit Suisse. Then I became Bank of America Global Head of Currency Options Trading, AIG's Global Emerging Markets Strategy Leader. This approach also allowed me to act as a global macro hedge fund manager, Helped me achieve the top return on investment in twelve years, He became the founder and chief information officer of two award-winning hedge funds. By 2001, I can't help thinking, this method Let me do well in school, Let me develop better in my career, Why don't I apply this method to my personal life, As I have achieved my career goals in this way? One day, I walked to work, My commute during that time was Walk from one end of Hyde Park to the other. It took me 45 minutes one way, Equivalent to one and a half hours a day, 7 and a half hours a week, 30 hours a month, 360 hours a year, Basically, I wasted this time in awake, Listen to music on my iPod. So when I came home one day, I went to a store. I purchased the first 33 CDs of the German Course ""Pimsleur Series"", Rip them into my iPod. And I didn't stop there. Because, the fact is that I am not a self-disciplined person. I know after a while, I would choose to give up studying and continue listening to music. So, in order not to be tempted, I uninstalled all the music. There is only one option left for me: Listen to language lessons. Ten months later, I finished listening to all 99 CDs. German language tutorial, I heard each one three times. Then I went to Berlin for a 16-day intensive German course. After the course, I invited my wife and children to meet me in Berlin. We strolled around the city. I speak to locals in German and they respond to me in German. My children are stunned. (laughter) They were so shocked they couldn't even close their mouths. But you and I know, Everything I just did is not a little bit remarkable. I made a slight adjustment in my daily routine. Subtle improvements were made throughout the process. (German) Und jetzt, ich spreche ein bisschen Deutsch. Now I can speak German. At that moment, I thought: This shouldn't be so easy--especially for an elderly person like me-- So quickly learned a new language. This should be something that children can do. And I can do it now. It is precisely this slight adjustment. So is there anything else for me Established after retirement, But is it possible to achieve the ambitious goal now? Maybe I can make a slight adjustment to my daily routine. So I started to act. I got a racing license, I learned how to fly a helicopter, Going to learn rock climbing and skydiving. I learned to fly. If you are like me, in 2007, You may have the same goals as me. I just returned from London. At that time, I was about 25 pounds overweight and totally out of shape. I want to change all this. I can use ordinary methods, For example, write a check to a gym I can't go to. Or I can swear to God I will not eat those I love again, But food harmful to the body. It is clear to me that the possibility of implementing this common method is very low. So I decided to become an active participant. I analyze the habits that form in my life. I think if I can make minor adjustments to them, Can they, in turn, become good for me? So I started to act. I have a habit, For seven years, I have spent an hour and a half walking every day, I have a strong passion for the outdoors. At that year, I did nâ€™t make a ""New Year\'s wish to lose 25 pounds"", Instead, I set up one and walked 33 Mountain climbing target on a hiking path in the Santa Barbara mountains. I had never climbed a mountain before. (laughter) But the fact is, the focus is not on those 33 hiking trails. You have to take this huge goal Break down into decisions that are acceptable to them-- In the process we make the right decision To increase our chances of success. The focus is not on every avenue, It's every small decision. When we sit at the desk, Try to squeeze some time before the end of the day. Or we lie on the sofa, Press the remote control to see different channels. Or reading information on Facebook, At that moment, decisions need to be made and set aside. Put on your mountaineering suit, Go out the door and leave everything behind Step into the car, start, and drive to the beginning of the trail. Get out of the car, Take the first step, take the second and third steps, Every step I just said, Need to make small, right choices In order to achieve the ultimate result. Every time, when I say I want to climb 33 paths, People think of the decisions I made on the top of the mountain. And that's not the point. Because if you lie on the sofa Didn't make the right decision, Well, there is no chance to make a decision on the mountaintop. That's it, at the end of that year, I climbed 33 paths, Even each path climbed several times. I even climbed several paths in the mountains. I lost 25 pounds. At the end of that year, I completed the most difficult half marathon in the world- Pier to Peak. In 2009, I set my goals very high. For a person who can't be quiet until now, It â€™s very ambitious for people who ca nâ€™t gather the center god for more than 10 minutes, That's reading 50 books. But again, the focus is still not on reading 50 books, Nor reading a book, Not even reading a chapter, a section, or a sentence. But before our day is over That decision made at the desk. Or lying on the sofa, When browsing information on Facebook, We put the phone down. Pick up a book and read the last word. If we could read the last word, we would read two words and three words; Will continue to read the last sentence, one section, one page, one chapter, one book; We will read 10, 30, 50 books. I set my goals even higher in 2012. I set 24 new year wishes. 12 of them are what I call ""generous wishes"", I need to complete 12 charitable deeds that do not involve money. But some of them failed. I try to donate blood, But it was rejected because I live in the UK. I tried to donate sperm and was rejected by the authorities because I was too old. I try to donate my hair, Only to find out that no one wants to have gray hair. (laughter) In the meantime, I try to do good deeds and make myself feel good, But only the opposite effect. In addition, I set 12 learning goals. Learn 12 skills. When I learned to ride a unicycle, parkour, take a soft rope, On stilts and drums, My wife suggested that I study knitting. (laughter) Honestly, I have no interest in knitting at all. But one day, when I was sitting under a 12-meter-high eucalyptus tree, â€”â€”It's 2.6 miles above the cold trail on the Santa Barbara Cold Stream, I think if this tree is wrapped in cotton yarn, it must be very cool! (laughter) Then I went home and searched, Someone did such a thing, it was called-Cotton Bomb: Wrap public buildings with cotton yarn. Coincidentally, the second World Cotton Yarn Bomb Day Just after 82 days. (laughter) That's it, in those 82 days, no matter where I am-- (laughter) In the conference room, on the exchange, On a plane, or in a hospital, I'm all practicing knitting. Repeatedly practice one stitch at a time. After 82 days, I completed the first cotton bomb in my life. (applause) The subsequent response really calmed me down. So I decided to keep going-- (laughter) Applied more engineering skills, To complete larger and more ambitious projects. In 2014, I set goals, Wrap six boulder rocks in the mountains of Los Padres National Forest. However, if I really want to accomplish my goal, I need help from others. At that time, I already had thousands of fans on social media, A fan of Cotton Bomber. (laughter) I started receiving parcels, lots of parcels-- 388 donors from 36 different countries, including all 50 states. Later, I wrapped more than one boulder, A total of 18 pieces were included. (applause) So I kept on working hard, A larger and more ambitious project was carried out. I also need to use more new materials, Such as fiberglass, wood, metal, etc. Finally integrated a project here at Tucson Hospital, I wrapped the Tucson Infant Hospital. (applause) After that, I stopped knitting. I didn't really like it. (laughter) but... I like crochet. (laughter) So, I made some 7-inch old grandmother square weavesâ€” Because this is the standard square weave size- In the process. I can't help wondering, why should I stop at 7 inches? I want a big one. So I started making bigger old grandma square weaves. One day after I went home on a business trip, I took this big square weaving, Visit the Guinness Book of Records page. I'm curious how big the oldest grandmother cube in the world is. It turned out that Guinness did not have this category. (laughter) So I went to apply, Then they rejected me. I appeal, They rejected me again. I appeal again and they say, okay. If you can make it 10 meters square, we will open a new category, And you can become the new Guinness World Record holder. That's it, for the next 2 years, 7 months, 17 days, One stitch at a time, I finally sewed more than half a million stitches, Used more than 30 miles of cotton yarn. And now i'm the biggest crochet in the world The official Guinness World Record holder for Old Grandmother Boxer. (Applause) (Cheers) My self-entertainment has attracted the attention of countless people all the way. I was published in Newsweek Magazine, There is also Eric News, a special issue of the artist. However, when you hear these achievements, I hope you understand: I'm still a C- student. I'm still the one who can't calm down, Focus on children over 5 or 10 minutes, Still the one without special talents or skills. I just put very big, grand plans, Plans that others find incredible, Broken down into the smallest items, And make minor improvements in the process To increase the chance of success. And the reason I gave this speech, I hope to inspire you Realize your grand dreams with action, No longer talking on paper, Make minor improvements in daily behavior and start practicing your dreams. Thank you! (applause)",0
45,"Letâ€™s say you need a little bit of lemon juice. You usually take your lemon and you cut it in half then you use a little bit of lemon juice and then youâ€™ve got all this lemon leftover so you put it in the fridge or something. And then when you come back it looks like this. Itâ€™s all rotten and dry and dehydrated and just rancid, you donâ€™t really want to use it anymore and itâ€™s hard and crunchy like this one. There must be a better way to preserve your lemon and still get your juice. Well there is, this is how, you take your lemon and you roll it and then you want to take a sort of pin and just poke in the bottom in the lemon, the exact bottom where the point is here, and then you squeeze and all the lemon juice you want just pours out. Now the great thing is you made a very small little hole in it now so oxygen canâ€™t really get into it and make it rot so it will stay fresher for longer. Make Butter Spreadable Sometimes you want to spread some butter but when you take it out of the fridge the butter is super hard and really hard to spread. This is super annoying, so what do you do? Usually you just pop it in the microwave but the issue with this is it always seems to over melt the butter and make it into a big soupy mess just like this. That can be very annoying so there must be a better way. Well there is, take a cheese grater and then you just grate your butter stick. Yes thatâ€™s right, grate your butter stick. Now that has two added benefits, one it delivers energy to the butter by the grating motion which makes it a bit softer, and also the higher surface area makes it softer quicker also. Lastly itâ€™s in this funny interesting spaghetti like consistency which now is super spreadable so you can just spread it on whatever you want and you have nice soft butter. Success! Easy Potato Peeling You just take a knife and a potato and you put them together and just twirl the potato around while you cut into the skin just softly in a circular motion, then you take it and you cook it like you normally would. Now by cooking the skin with the potato you actually infuse the potato with more flavor because most of the flavor of the potato is actually in the skin so you get more potatoy mash. Once youâ€™ve cooked it, you can just pull the skin off just like this and itâ€™s so much more efficient, you donâ€™t waste any potato and itâ€™s much quicker than peeling it. Peeling Hardboiled Eggs Take a hardboiled egg, place it in a jar, add a little bit of water to cover then you just place your hand over the jar and shake it like mad. Once youâ€™re done which is pretty soon, you just take out and the shell is basically fall off the boiled egg and itâ€™s that easy to remove. Alright, trick number five staying on the same shaking idea this is a garlic bowl and Iâ€™m just going to place it in a jar and again shake like mad. Okay, once youâ€™ve done that for a little bit then you just pop it out and you just remove some of the husks because they will get in the way. Once you have removed the husks just put all these garlic cloves back inside, alright. Put the lid back on and again shake like crazy, keep shaking, just carry on shaking. And now you just pop it out and all the skins have separated from the cloves. You can just pick them away and put them to one side then youâ€™ve got these beautiful little garlic cloves and if any of the skin is still on you can put them in the jar and shake again or just easily pull it off very easily like that. Make Bread Fresh Again! I hate when you have old bread and itâ€™s super hard and you canâ€™t use it anymore. Thatâ€™s why I always keep my bread inside a plastic bag so it stays soft, just like this one here and then you can still resuscitate here. Iâ€™ve got soft bread but itâ€™s very, very old and to resuscitate it all youâ€™re going to need is just some water. Iâ€™m going to put this here so I can pour some water over it, basically just pour the water over it and pour it on the bottom also and then you want to place it into an oven at 180-degrees Celsius, thatâ€™s 356-degrees Fahrenheit. Youâ€™re going to want to leave it in there for about three minutes and after three minutes have passed then you just want to turn it around and then hit it up for another three minutes. If itâ€™s still soft or not done enough just leave it a bit longer. But once itâ€™s done you just pull it out and itâ€™s crispy again and crunchy just like it was from the bakers and the inside is nice and soft and tender and steamy, just delicious fresh bread and this is like an old bread, this is like a week old really. But itâ€™s super usable again and just great to use, so give this a try at home and let me know what you think. Crazy Way to Open Wine For this trick letâ€™s assume you canâ€™t find your bottle opener but you do happen to find your blow torch. Well just take it and turn it on then aim it at the little air gap in between the cork and the wine and what will happen is it will heat up the air and make it expand pushing the cork out the top in a nice little explosive bang â€“ just like this. Success! Alright now you turn your blow torch off and pour out your wine like you usually would and enjoy it. There we go, done! The Black Egg Alright so this next trick is called the Black Egg and for this youâ€™re just going to crack and egg into a bowl and then separate out the yolk. The simplest way to do this is just with a spoon, you scoop it out like this and just pop it in the other bowl. Now Iâ€™m going to add some black cuttlefish ink but if you donâ€™t like the savory fishy taste this has you can always just use black food coloring and just mix it together like this. Once youâ€™ve mixed it together then youâ€™re going to want to fry it. Here I am going to put some oil on a pan and here Iâ€™m going to pop it in. One thing that happens is when you beat egg whites they become a bit more runny so they will spread out more than you want. If that happens just simply push the sides in like this just to keep in an egg sort of shape. Alright now youâ€™re going to want to add your egg yolk back in, so just add it on like this and put it into position where you want it to be. Once itâ€™s done cooking there you go, itâ€™ simple, done. Just cook it like you would a normal sunny side up fried egg. This is just a very simple way to make something mundane look very, very different and interesting. I hope you enjoy it! Testing Eggs for Freshness Sometimes youâ€™ve got some eggs and you just donâ€™t know whether theyâ€™re fresh or not. Itâ€™s kind of impossible to look at an egg and know if itâ€™s fresh even though most grocery stores these days do print the date on them just like so, but sometimes these get rubbed off because of some other reason that we just donâ€™t know. Now in that kind of case what do you do to figure out if an egg is fresh or not? Well hereâ€™s a simple trick, just drop your egg in some water and the fresh ones will sink to the bottom just like this and the un-fresh ones will float to the top just like so. Now the great thing about this trick is you can do it with multiple eggs if you happen to have a big enough tub and then you can easily detect which eggs are fresh and which eggs are no good. For example here, these two are no good Iâ€™m just going to dispose of them and cook with the rest. Super Poached Eggs Now Iâ€™m going to show you an amazing new way to make poached eggs even better. Start off by taking an egg and separating it like this, now you want to take some basil and just finely chop it up, so cut it like this and chop it up like that. Now you can use any other herb you like but the combination of what Iâ€™m showing you is pretty good. Take your basil and add it to your egg whites, just like this and then add a little bit of mozzarella cheese, but you can add any other cheese you like or any other ingredients for that matter. You can put little bits of mushroom or little bacon bits, whatever you like with eggs. Once itâ€™s mixed up take another bowl, take some cling film dent it into the bowl then spray it with oil so you can un-stick it later. Place half your mixture into the bowl like this. Now place your egg yolk and cover it up with the rest of the mixture just like so. Okay now to close it up, you just bring up the sides and you can tie this into a knot or use a little piece of string and tie a knot around it, or you can use one of these simple cheap little clamps and just clamp it shut. You can get this everywhere, itâ€™s no point mentioning it. Now to cook it, Iâ€™m going to place it in some simmering water for five minutes to get a nice runny egg yolk, but you can cook it a little bit longer if you want to have a more hard egg yolk. Okay so once itâ€™s done just take it out, and then you just un-clamp it and Iâ€™m going to place it here on some bread and itâ€™s delicious like this but you can also add it in say an Eggs Benedict recipe or some salad, or just anywhere you want to use a poached egg. This is just way better and more tasty. END",0
261,"From high up on pillars to deep in the Antarctic, here are 10 of the most amazing isolated homes in the world!! 10. The Drina River House You’ve always wanted a house surrounded by a moat, right? Everyone has!! But how about taking it a step further and building your home in the middle of a river? Well, that’s what a group of boys decided to do in 1968 when they were looking for the ideal spot to sunbathe. The rock they chose wasn’t so comfortable so over time they added floorboards, then walls, and then a roof- with all materials transported to the site by boat. The house has, unsurprisingly, been victim to flooding of the Drina river, which nearly destroyed it several times. Every time it was built again from the ground up. Despite its remote location on the eastern edge of the Tara national park in Serbia, it’s still fairly close to the local town of Bajina Basta, so there’s not too far to go to get supplies. Even so, this solitary house seems as if it were just surrounded by nothing but nature for miles around. 9. Casa Do Penedo The Casa Do Penedo, which means the house of stone, is in the Fafe mountains of northern Portugal. The 16.5-foot-tall house, built at 2,600 feet above sea level, is often referred to as the ‘Flintstones House’, and it’s clear to see why. The house has actually been constructed between 4 large granite boulders, and took two years to complete after work began in 1972. While it doesn’t have any electricity, to keep with the Flintstones theme, it does have a large fireplace, and even a swimming pool that’s carved into one of the bigger rocks. For those concerned about safety, not that I think you were worried, but you’ll be glad to hear that the doors and windows are all completely bulletproof- something that would have keep the owners feeling secure when they spent their holidays there. Not sure why they thought that was necessary!! You’ll have to go there to find out! Now, the house has been turned into a museum, and is open to any visitors willing to make the morning’s walk up the side of a mountain to see it. 8. The Crystal Mill The Crystal Mill is one of the most famous, and isolated, homes in Colorado. It was built on a rocky outcrop in the Crystal river, and is surrounded by the most amazing views! It’s about 6 miles away from Marble, and is close to the former town of Crystal. It’s so remote, that it’s only accessible during summer and fall months by a 1 lane track, and only accessible by foot across treacherous terrain at other times of the year. It’s best to only really go there if the weather is good. The mill was originally constructed in 1893, and the flowing water would be used to power its air compressor which, in turn, powered drills in the nearby mines. It was known as the Sheep Mountain Power House, and was crucial for the miners to be able to drill the holes into the rock. Then they would fill them with dynamite and blow everything up to release the ore. The mill’s functional role ended in 1917, and has since been used as a home and a popular visitors attraction. Which do you prefer, the Flintsones or the Mine?? 7. Katskhi Pillar How far would you go for your beliefs? Religious devotion can lead people to make big sacrifices for their faith, but one monk has taken the idea of isolation to a whole new level. Maxime Qavtaradze has spent the past 20 years living in a cottage on the Katskhi Pillar- a 131-foot-tall rock that stands above his monastery in Georgia. He lives his life in almost complete solitude high above his Georgian monastery. It’s such an isolated place that the only means of accessing the home is by a 131 foot ladder, something that takes 20 minutes in each direction. Maxime does it twice a week to pray with his followers. Maxime became a monk after doing time in prison and he wanted to make a change. There is now a small religious community down below and his followers also winch supplies and other things to him whenever he needs them. He very rarely allows visitors to climb the pillar- those that do are required to spend a number of days praying at the base before being deemed pure enough to make the ascent. Originally it took him years to complete construction of his cottage, and to start with he was forced to sleep in an old fridge until he had hoisted a bed frame up there. It might seem like an extreme place to live, but the practise of living on top of the Katskhi pillar has its roots in the 15th century when Christian monks would live in such places to avoid worldly temptation. That way, it was easier to feel closer to God and feel his presence. 6. Wordie House If you like the cold, and staying indoors for most of the year, then maybe this is the place for you. Wordie House is one of the most remote buildings on the planet- located on Winter Island in Antarctica. It was a former outpost, known as Base F, that was set up by the British during the second world war to protect their interests from Argentina! After that, it became a base for scientific operations in the following years. Its role was primarily as a meteorological research station, but in 1954, it was replaced by another outpost on a nearby island, leaving Base F as a relic of a far gone age. Today it’s known as Wordie House, in honour of James Wordie, the chief scientist on Shackleton’s trans Antarctic mission between 1914 and 1917. It’s maintained by the British Antarctic Heritage Trust, and remains virtually identical to how it was when it was in use. It has a kitchen and a bunk room to hold up to 5 people, with a wooden stove for warmth. The bookcases along the walls are full of books and board games, a telling sign that there wasn’t much to do here over the winter months when it would snow for days on end. You can actually go visit and stay at the house today, and it offers a unique opportunity to see how people used to live. The kitchen still has cans of coffee and potatoes, the old radio equipment is still the pride of place, and the instructions for the rudimentary fire prevention methods are still pinned up on the wall by the entrance. If you need an escape from the world, this is it!!! 5. Long Studio The Long Studio, on Fogo Island in Newfoundland, Canada, was built to give artists a secluded space to work. The modern structure has been built on a series of stilts to raise it above the ground- which makes it feel as if it’s hovering over the landscape. It’s made from traditional materials from the region, such as the rough-sawn pine used on the exterior, and whitewashed spruce inside, and is split into 3 parts- the entrance porch, a courtyard, and a studio or living space. It was inspired by the local fishermen’s houses. It’s a completely self sustaining building, with power provided from solar panels, and its own waste treatment facilities. Designed by Norwegian architects, Saunders Architecture, the Long Studio is actually a proof of concept design that they are planning to replicate in other sites across Canada as well. It’s a special way to breathe new life onto the island. It kind of reminds me of the Svalbard Global Seed Vault in Norway? Do you think so? 4. The Solvay Hut Located on the north eastern ridge of the Matterhorn mountain in Switzerland, the Solvay Hut is the highest mountain hut owned by the Swiss Alpine Club, at 13,133 feet above sea level. The club has a number of huts in the mountains which provide shelter and food to anyone who needs it, but the Solvay hut is by far the most remote, and is intended for use in emergencies only. It was originally built in 1915, when the materials were carried most of the distance by animals, and then a temporary cable car was constructed solely to help with moving the larger pieces on the final stretch. It was fully rebuilt in 1966, but was only fitted with an emergency telephone as late as 1976. This hut really is on top of the world, and is only 1,500 feet from the summit of the Matterhorn. Its precarious position on a ledge offers spectacular views across the mountain range, and is a favourite spot for climbers to take a well earned break before completing their trip. 3. Ellidaey Island If you really want an isolated home, and an entire island to go with it- then how about Ellidaey island in Iceland? It’s a part of the Vestmannaeyjar archipelago to the south of the country, and there’s quite a mystery to the place. It’s believed that people have lived there for more than 300 years, mainly because of the abundant puffin population that they hunted and sold to the mainland, as well as raising cattle on the pastures. In such an isolated place, though, it became impractical to keep living like this, so by the 1930’s, the island had been completely abandoned. They went on to find, however, that there was nowhere quite like this to find puffins, so a lodge was built on the island so they would have somewhere to stay when they returned on a trip. Since then, there have been intermittent residents in the one structure that remains there. You are surrounded by natural wildlife and complete solitude! There’s also a rumour that the government of Iceland has actually given the island to the singer Bjork as thanks for increasing Iceland’s notoriety around the world. While these rumours remain unsubstantiated, there’s still a chance that if you were to spend time here, you’d be wondering to yourself why “it’s oh, so quiet…” 2. San Colombano Hermitage First built in 1319, the San Colombano hermitage was named after the Irish Saint Colomban who, according to legend, took up residence in the cave after vanquishing the dragon that originally lived there. A small church was then built at the entrance to one of the small caves to provide accommodation for pilgrims and monks. As you can see, it’s quite high up on the rock face, and is accessible by 102 steps that have been cut into the rock and lead to a path across the gorge of the river Leno beneath. The Hermitage was in constant use until 1782, and then was looked after by the local people who lived in the valley. More recently, in 1996, the local authorities conducted extensive restoration work to bring back the original beauty of the place- including frescoes that depict Saint Colomban battling the dragon, an image of paradise, and the main altar which features a 15th century Madonna surrounded by saints. 1. Just Room Enough Island Just room enough island is, as the name would suggest, a small piece of land that is just room enough for a house, and barely anything else! It’s one of the almost 2,000 islands of the Thousand Islands chain on the New York side of the St Lawrence River, and is the location of one of the most famous isolated homes in the region. The island was bought by the Sizeland family in the 1950’s who were looking for a private holiday retreat. They built their house with the walls as far to the edge of the land as possible, and placed a benchon the front next to the tree, and that’s all the space they had. The house has its own generator and because it’s not connected to the mainland, it is still used today as a retreat. I don’t know about you but being THAT close to the water makes me nervous!! While the original intent was for the family to have peace and isolation, the peculiar home soon attracted the attention of sightseers and tourists who wanted to see it for themselves, and made the river a lot busier than it had been before. It feels more like a houseboat than a house on an island, (so much for the peaceful moat idea) and many have questioned whether it even counts as an island in the first place. It could just be considered a house on a rock!! Different areas have different classifications for what constitutes an island, and here an island is defined as a piece of land that is larger than 1 square foot, is permanently above water level, and sustains at least one tree. By those metrics, Just Room Enough Island is definitely an island, but if the owners decide to build a floating garage extension, it’ll surely be up for debate! Thanks for watching!!",0

375,"6 years ago, I was sitting with my friends in New York When he found a notification on my phone, I was amazed to find a text message from my grandmother. I was surprised because my grandmother was 78 at the time, She had never sent a text message before. And I'll tell you that the first message was great. She said, ""Dear Andrew, I'm trying to write a letter. My love, your grandmother."" And I said, ""She thinks it's a letter!"" She replied to her message, ""Hi Grandma, it's a message. You don't have to include all of it."" Her response was, ""Dear Andrew, OK. My love, your grandmother. "" My favorite part is always ""my love, your grandmother."" If it were ""my love, the grandmother"", I would be confused. And if she said, dear Andrew, have fun in Texas, my love, grandmother, I'll be surprised, ""Grandma? Who is Grandma?"" (Laughter) But my grandmother still knows some things. Two years ago, I went to Switzerland to work, I came back, and I sent a message to my grandmother: Hi my grandmother, I just came from Switzerland. "" Her response was, ""Dear Andrew, Switzerland? (WTF)"" (Laughter) So, I called my grandmother, Grandma, what do you mean by (WTF)? And she said, ""Well, someone told me at the bridge that it means (Wow, that's fun)."" (Laughter) And I said, ""That's exactly what you mean."" I will not explain it to my grandmother. But over time, I realized I think the world may be a happier place If most people think of (WTF) - If most people are like my grandmother and think ""Wow, that's fun."" Because in 2012, I quit my job at P&amp;G. To teach people the value of humor. She has worked with more than 35,000 people in more than 250 organizations On how to be more productive, happy, and less stressful with humor. But when people hear about what I'm doing, they're a little bit skeptical, (Laughter) Because no one thinks humor is a bad thing. Is there someone here who doesn't like to laugh? Anyone say ""No, I hate having fun in my body?"" (Laughter) No, people think humor is secondary. If I enjoy my job more, if I have some fun, it would be great, But if not, well. The truth is, humor is a must. In today's culture, exhausted, unappreciated, strained and sleep deprived Humor is necessary. Because humor makes people listen, It increases long-term memory retention, It improves understanding and helps in learning And help deliver messages. Group cohesion also improved, Reduces differences, defuses conflicts, and builds confidence. And people got close to each other. It does these things (Laughter) These are many things ... All are based on case studies research and real examples. (Laughter) And these are some of its amazing benefits, right? Humor can help you look better, live longer, and make it rain, right? (Laughter) Because people who use humor get better pay. And anyone can learn these benefits. Because when I talk to people about humor or comedy, Sometimes they are afraid. That event I went to in Switzerland two years ago And that made my grandmother say (WTF), He was scheduled to speak at a conference. And one of the speakers at that conference was this mr. His name is ""Kevin Richardson"". Also known as the whisper of lions. If you see a YouTube video of a lion hugging a man, it is this person. He lives in South Africa, And he raises black from a young age, They treat him like one of the herd. It is mainly the human version of ""Raviki"" in ""The Lion King"". But Kevin and I were talking before the event. And found out that I'm performing impromptu comedy, ""I can never do that, it is very scary,"" he said. (Laughter) And I said ""But you live with lions!"" (Laughter) It's like making a joke more terrifying than living with lions. (Laughter) But many people have this perception As if the ability to make people laugh is somehow encoded in our DNA. (Laughter) But the truth is that humor is a skill, And if it's a skill, then that means you can learn it. Because I am one of the people who have learned how to use humor. Because I made a lot of shows As an impromptu, improvised, narrated and eloquent comedian. She performed in 50 states, 18 countries and one planet. (Laughter) And I have fans in over 150 countries, Depending on the people who entered my site by chance. I was described as humorous and intelligent, at least that's what my mom says. (Laughter) And I was seen on ""The Daily Show"" with John Stewart, among the audience. (Laughter) I recently went to a school reunion party, And when people found out that I was working as a stand-up comedian, They said, ""But you are not fun."" In some ways, they are right Because I will tell you that this is not a fun face. (Laughter) There is so much fun about this picture; None of them is intentional. (Laughter) I have blonde parties on top of my head as if I wanted to be in a band. The topic was ""To dream,"" but I am not anyone's dream .. (Laughter) in this picture. Because when I matured, I had no spirit of celebration or was a class clown. In the final year, I was chosen to be a spoiled teacher boy. This will surprise many of you, but this is because I am complicated. If you are wondering what type of complexity, The answer is yes: computer, mathematics, science fiction, Dungeons and Dragon, Star Wars, Star Track, Starbucks, all. (Laughter) But specifically, an engineer. I joined Ohio State University, She obtained a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering. After graduation, I started working at Bacter &amp; Gamble as an IT Project Manager. And that's what people expected me to do, Because based on my personal assessment, That's what it suggests that I should be a computer science engineer. But I learned that we are not as a personality assessment, Because my review means I am Class A blue square, Al-Dameer neighborhood, Intig with a watermark. This means that I am ambitious, stubborn, and introverted He loves long walks on the beach, But I learned that we are not like our personal assessments. It may give us insight into our behavior Or tell us what drives us Or tell us which Disney princess we might be like Pocahontas. (Laughter) But she does not know our personalities; it is our actions that define her. So I started doing comedy in college. My best friend in the middle wanted to make a group for impromptu comedy. And he wanted people and forced me to join. And you can tell me from this picture that we were not adept. At least to get started, we had no idea what we were doing. And we watched the program, ""To whom is this line anyway?"" And we tried to repeat what we saw. What lacked me in the skill of comedy was that I created comedy project management. ""If we are going to do it seriously; We have to train three times a week, And we will have a business meeting every Monday, We will again see our shows as a match bar. "" And over two years, we got better. We moved on from the exercise in the basement of the university city To rehearse at the university theater twice a week, We never learned how to take a good picture. But that's how you learn the skill of humor. Through practice and repetition. And anyone can do these things. You don't have to become a professional comedian to use comedy, But we can learn from professionals. For example, from impromptu shows, we learn how to share your opinions. Because Louis CK has a specific perspective on seeing the world, Which differs from ""Ellen de Generis"", Which differs from ""Tig Notaro,"" ""Dave Chappelle,"" or ""Chris Rock."" Everyone has their own perspective. Some people told me I look like a combination of Hugh Jackman and Conan O'Brien. (Laughter) Others told me, ""As if I see David Tennant, Dr. Hu's actor."" And a lady told me, I think you look like Justin Timberlake, but from here to here. (Laughter) I will ignore the person who told me I look like ""Clay Aiken"". Totally Correct. Everyone has their own perspective. And we can use that perspective as a way to communicate with others, right? We can use it to say, ""We are alike."" How many people here love candy? People love sweets. I love sweets. I am obsessed with milkshakes. It's the best possible candy. Because of the good taste of the ice cream in a way that is easy to eat. But I do not understand chocolate mint. I do not know any fan of chocolate mint. I have not eaten chocolate before ""Do you know what this taste looks like? Toothpaste"" (Laughter) We can share a perspective as a way to communicate. We can also share a perspective to prove a point. Because I will tell you I have always understood computers more than my understanding of humans. Because when something goes wrong with the computer, We receive an error message. But when something goes wrong with a human being, You find feelings. (Laughter) Things will get easier if a person comes with wrong messages, is not it? Saying you're exhausted, exhausted, and a little pressured, It will only appear: ""Warning! System overload."" (Laughter) ""Please restart after taking a nap."" Because we all know that naps are the human version From ""Just close it and restart it again."" Some error messages will not have to be changed. For example, outside you are courting a waitress, and she didn't feel it. It will only appear: ""Error. Unable to establish a connection to the server."" (Laughter) Things will get very easy. But in reality, humans are not computers, Regardless of how wonderful they pretend to be. Because, as human beings, we need not only time management, but also energy management. Because it doesn't matter what time we have If we don't have the energy to do anything with it. From improvised presentations, we learned how to discover and highlight an opinion. Because the primary thinking style for improvisation is ""yes, then dwell on"". How Improvisers in Yossi Be, Second City and Comedy Sports Create Things In their head. And how can we do the same? Follow their example, accept and build, discover, highlight and say, ""If this is true, what else is true?"" Because that led me to realize Florida The rapper, ""Flow Raida"", was named after his native Florida And put a space between him. And that surprised me! (Laughter) We can say, ""If this is true, what else could be true?"" We can say, ""I think there should be a Spanish factory in Dover To be closer to de la ware. (Laughter) Or like, ""There might be an Internet checker in Biloxi To be closer to Macy's. (Laughter) If this is true, what else is true? If we use ""yes, dwell"" to create humor, We can also use ""yes, then redundancy"" as a way to communicate with others. We can think of those short, typical conversations When people say, ""What do you think about the weather?"" It says, ""Yes, and if you are not abroad now, How will you enjoy the weather outside? "" We can turn any embarrassing conversation into something more useful When you can get to know the person. ""Nice weather like this, go out, park or swim."" If you were me, you would stay home, because you are so pale. I like to use sunscreen buildings; they are the best. Get to know people by agreeing to ""Yes, then verbally"" We can also use the principle of approval and then elaborate for more fun Because the truth is that the average people work is 90 thousand hours in their lives. 90 thousand hours! For that entire period, the netflix discs list is complete. That's a lot of time. And we can say, ""Yes, I'm going to work 90,000 hours, And I enjoy it too. "" Between my first and last year in high school, I worked at a factory, And I'll tell you it wasn't a pleasant job. And then, I thought maybe, in the future, I would like to become a global hip-hop superstar. So, to pass the time, I thought about rhymes in my head, I wrote it down in a little notebook later. And I found one of these notes I discovered why I had never become a hip-hop superstar. Because one of these rhymes was, Hydrogen plus hydrogen plus oxygen also combined with covalent glue. What will you get, just something called water, Yes, it forms a team, and it gets hotter. "" (Laughter) That is why I have never become a hip-hop superstar. But it still helps me to spend time, create humor and fun. And at the end of the scene, We can learn the importance of commitment to performance. Because the characters on Saturday Night Live, Ki and Bill, and Monty Python. They are very fun, because the actors are committed to performing. They trust their presentations, Because it's like dating, isn't it? People tell you they want to date trusted people. Two years ago, I was with some friends in a bar, And I saw this beautiful girl at the bar. ""You should talk to her."" ""I can not do that."" ""Why not?"" ""I have no trick"" ""You don't need a trick, but you just need confidence."" But they do not tell you that they want that confidence in some areas. Because no lady does not need a man with confidence in mathematics. (Laughter) This is what I have. (Laughter) So I said, ""Okay. I'll try to start a conversation using math."" So, I went to the girl and said, ""Hey, girl."" (Laughter) ""Are you a vertical asymptote? Because your beauty has no limits."" (Laughter) And she said, ""What did you say now?"" (Laughter) And I started again, and I said, ""Hey, girl. Are you the opposite corner of the hypotenuse? Because you make me sin. "" (Laughter) And she said, ""I think you better leave."" So she left, okay? But a few hours later, I said, ""What I had to say is, ""Girl, you are much higher than average, don't be cruel."" (Laughter) He brought it up with you before, When you think about something for 4 hours after the event? That's really a good thing, and it's called ideal thinking too late. The idea that ""this moment is happening now,"" And later you think about this idea on the stairs. And that's a good sign, because that means you have a comedic talent. Through practice and repetition, You can shorten the time it takes to create humor From 4 hours to 3 hours later, Just two hours, 10 minutes, to what is happening now. Because reflection of the past leads to work in the future. With that, we become more comfortable and confident using humor, The more we actually do it. Like what my mom (Cody) says: ""pretend to be successful."" I know there are some people Who say, ""Well, Justin Timberlake's eyes."" (Laughter) ""And what if I'm not fun?"" The truth is that if I laugh at someone before, Even if it was because of your failure during your climb, Then you might still use humor. But even if you are not ready to try to create humor, You can still benefit from humor by being a sponsor. You can share quotes, TED conversations that you enjoyed, Or you can use the images in your presentations. Because I did not take this picture. I did not go to Sri Lanka. I don't know this shepherd or any of these goats. I found it on Flickr under a Creative Commons license I shared it with you, because I enjoyed it. But even if you are not ready to create humor, And don't think you can find something interesting on the Internet, You can still use humor if you know how to smile. Because when you see another person smile, We are ready to reverse that behavior unlike the neurons in our minds. And when we smile, they smile: we create human contact. Others say, ""But if no one laughs? And what if you tried humor, and there was an embarrassing silence? "" It will be embarrassing only if you spend time on it, If you get caught up in it. The truth is that no one was fired for a silly joke. Maybe an inappropriate joke, but not bad. Because the silly joke is like, ""I had to miss the class because of the low temperature I was too cold to go to school. "" (Laughter) This is a silly joke. (Laughter) An inappropriate joke is an inappropriate subject. Or the target is inappropriate, or occur at an inappropriate time. But as long as we are positive. (Laughter) And we will be okay. Because if no one laughs at our prank, It is only a comprehensive and positive statement. In the end, people say ""What if no one takes me seriously?"" ""What if people think I'm a clown or a tumbler?"" If you are going to use humor to work, I realize that humor will not replace work. Humor is like table salt. You can't have a meal full of salt, right? Because that might make you a horse. Would you like to be a horse? I say no. (Laughter) But you can still use humor It always makes it more productive. Managers really want it. Because they know that you will be more involved and achieve better results. But let's say you work in an organization that states fun! The truth is that no one can control your thinking. No one can stop you from listening to comedy broadcasts On your way to work Thus, you relieve stress and become more present among your family. No one can stop you from creating a Twitter account to play with words. No one can stop you from composing rap chemistry while you work. The truth is that job satisfaction, your point of view, and your method of stress management It is your responsibility, and it is your choice. This is a skill of humor. Begins with sharing your point of view, Discover and highlight this point of view. We use the principle of approval and elaboration in our work and life. In the end, we practice, do, and repeat, Because that makes us improve. People can take an improvisation lesson, or try to improvise comedies, But we can be more familiar with how to create humor every day. And everyone can do these things. And I will tell you, the envelope of someone I know is my grandmother, who wrote to me. And raised its level of writing letters to Facebook. She is now on Facebook and comments on all updates to my case. I cannot tell you If my grandmother is the most honest and loyal in the world, Or she mocks me secretly. (Laughter) Two months ago they were published ""I try to decide if I should become a sports player or a criminal, I have prepared a list of pros and cons. "" My grandmother’s response was one word: “funny.” (Laughter) And I said, ""I don't know. Do you think it's funny, or do you mess with me? "" Two weeks later, I published, ""I think a cozy brasserie serving figs can make dating great."" My grandmother's response was, ""Ha, ha."" (Laughter) And I said, ""There is something wrong about the comma."" (Laughter) And I said, ""She messes with me."" Two weeks later, it was published ""Converting the numbers 51,6 and 500 into Roman numerals makes me angry."" (Laughter) My grandmother replied, ""This is really good."" (Laughter) My grandmother mocks me. (Laughter) It doesn't matter how old you are, your income, or your point of view, Your personal evaluation, or super alumni of your school Or your famous peers. Anyone can learn to be funny. And it all starts with a choice, Choosing to try to find ways to use humor, Choose to be like my grandmother, To see the world around you and think about ""WTF"" Wow, that's fun. thank you (clap)",0
333,I had a friend he he he he didn't come to a good end this this person it was a real good friend of mine when I was in junior high and high school and he was kind of crazy and he was tall he was about six foot seven and he was pretty thin and we used to go up to the bar now and then and in many of the bars that we were in we lived in this little town there were bullies and these were guys and I worked in the bars and I used to watch these guys and they'd basically there's a handful of them in town pretty psychopathic types and they'd go to the bar and all they do is sit there and wait for someone to come in who they could beat up and they knew who it was as soon as they walked in that's actually why they were at the bar and so they'd wait till someone came in who didn't look very confident and who could likely be intimidated by by this sort of thing and then they'd tell him to come outside for a fight and if they didn't well then they of course make fun of them and if they did well generally they beat them up my friend kind of caught on to this trick and he started going to bars and every time that someone like that came near him he'd go outside and fight with them and one of the things he observed right away is that almost inevitably when he went outside with them they'd shake hands and make friends so as soon as he's and it was really remarkable watching him cuz he wasn't he wasn't a particularly physically powerful person although he was extraordinarily tall but he had started to play this game and he did it for a long time and I don't remember him ever actually having to fight he just stared them down fundamentally so it was very interesting thing to watch but it was an indication to me of exactly how shallow this kind of bravado bullying actually is but people don't people don't find that out because they won't stand up and it's not surprising but anyways they load up on food Pinocchio's carrying a pie and an ice cream cone simultaneously and then they're off to have a fight and lambic says something like it's good to punch someone in the nose sometimes just for the I think he says heck of it and so Pinocchio adopts this strut and then they go to the roughhouse and then in the next scene you see this model hole up for destruction it's quite an interesting scene symbolically the kids are starting to burn this place and to trash it and they're dragging a grand piano down the down the stairs the destruction of high culture about which they're nothing but cynical because they don't believe that hard work and sacrifice can can produce something of any value and they want to bring it down and destroy it you shouldn't take some risks when you're a teenager and also later in life and so if you won't take any risks there's actually something wrong with you but there's a negative element in that well you know teenagers do all sorts of stupid things and perhaps it's amazing that we all live through it actually as far as I'm concerned and some people take extraordinarily risk extraordinary risks and they don't make it through at all or they end up in a permanently antisocial population and then they're you know basically career criminals five percent of the criminals commit 95 percent of the crimes it's another period of distribution so I used to live in Montreal I lived in a poor neighborhood and one day I was out in the back alley building a fence because I was putting a little fence around my back my little tiny backyard and there was a house across the alley down the street aways where there was a lot of like not good partying a lot of bikers were hanging around there and I knew there was a little kid that lived there as well anyways I was out there in the back alley pounding away on my fence and these little kids came up and they were little they were like three and four years old hey and they spoke you all right kind of really heavily accented came back off French and so my French isn't good so I could hardly understand them but they were what they were watching me hammer and they got a little closer and they had one one kid who was clearly the leader had a real scowl on his face Hey and so they were watching and I kind of motioned to one of them that they could use the hammer and that kid said and I'm gonna mangle this but he said gee of olay or something like that and what it meant has I'll steal that and so I thought you know and then he came over and he tugged on it and he wanted me to take it and he was quite angry and well I was gonna let him take it and then so so I couldn't engage him I couldn't get him to play you know and his buddies were sort of hanging around behind him and they wouldn't come and play because he wouldn't and so he was hostile right away to me and then so the fence piece was laying out in the alley and these little monsters started running across it which I thought was really remarkable you know but it was a terrible at the same time because they were really little kids that shouldn't be happening when you're like three or four if that's happening at that age things are not good and so that kid was already like seriously not happy with the world and you know I'd been studying antisocial behavior for a long time by that point and I knew that the kids who are destined to jail later in their lives are kids who are rough and tough when they're 2 years old but then don't get socialized or maybe worse they get anti socialized which is exactly what happened to this kid he'd obviously been ignored and abused certainly no one had ever played with him in any real way because he he wouldn't play and it's not good if a kid is that little and you can't get them to play something's gone seriously wrong because they're so playful at that age that like it's like 90% of them anyways so they were running back and forth on this fence I thought stomping on it you know and I was right there I thought well I first of all I thought that was remarkable but I also thought it was absolutely horrifying because you know in some sense I could see where this kid was headed and why at that early stage in his life it's really it's not a pleasant thing to behold if you're not doing very well especially if that's your own fault if you're not doing very well and you're around someone who's doing very well it's very painful because the mere fact of their being judges you and so it's very easy to want to destroy that to destroy that ideal so that you don't have to live with the terrible consequences of seeing it embodied in front of you and so part of the reason that people want to tear things down is so that they don't have anything to contrast themselves against and to feel bad and that's exactly what's happening here the kids are destroying all of this culture roughly speaking because it judges them the fact that it exists judges them and I've often thought this about Michelangelo's Statue of David which is this heroics so David was a shepherd obviously and it doesn't sound like much but back in those times being a shepherd was a big deal because their reliance and you had a slingshot and so like you got to defend your sheep from lions with a slingshot so you weren't exactly this like 19th century English guy dressed in a you know fully blue suit you were tough as a bloody well someone who would go after a lion with a slingshot it's no joke anyways the statue is very heroic and you know you look at that you think well that's the possibility of of humankind but by the same token it's also what you're not and so as well as being an ideal it's a judge and every ideal is a judge this is Pleasure Island here it's full of amusement park rides and you know one of the things that's kind of interesting about horror movies you I'm sure you've noticed this is that they're often sat at amusement parks and clowns are often characters of horror will leave the clown's aside for now but the amusement park thing that's pretty interesting it's like why in the world with an amusement park be a place of horror and the first question might be well have you ever been to an amusement park because there is something about them that's really they have a dark side a clear dark side and part of it is that people with nothing better to do are spending money stupidly and they're being fleeced by the people who operate the the amusement park you know and they have let's say a stereotypically dark reputation and they're moving around all the time which is also something that Psychopaths do and all they're doing is moving from community to community and taking the money from the rubes fundamentally and so the amusement park well if you walk through an amusement park with that sort of thing in mind maybe that's also coloring your vision of course but it's something that you can see very immediately so there's something about them that's sort of deeply sad but there's also that under there's an underlying horror that characterizes them that it's easy for horror movie and/or horror novel writers to immediately expand upon and there's something about it that that makes sense to people so it's too easy maybe that's and it's also all short-term gratification that's the other thing so you spend your money very rapidly and it's gone and so part of the problem with the hedonic answer is happy win exactly and over what period of time and also who's happy because maybe something makes you happy but makes your family miserable now you could say well I don't care but you do care if you have to live with your family because they're gonna take it out on you so so the the impulse of hedonism which is also fostered say by a positive emotion it tends to put people into a state of the pursuit of short-term hedonism it's not a good long-term or medium to long term solution I actually think that's why people evolved conscientiousness right because conscientiousness is not happy conscientious people aren't conscientious because it makes them happy we're starting to think that their conscientious because they actually feel terrible if they're just sitting around doing nothing and so it's a way of staving off stress the stress that's related to enforced leisure something like that you know you if you know industrious people some of you'll have it some of you are industrious some of you'll have industrious parents they just can't sit around and do nothing they have to be working they don't feel good unless they're working so what thing about conscientiousness is that it involves continual sacrifice right you're doing difficult things in the present hypothetically to make the future better but that's not driven by hedonism by any stretch of the imagination and conscientiousness is actually a pretty good predictor of long-term life success in stable societies because there's also no point in being conscientious and saving things up and storing things if a bunch of thugs are going to just come in randomly in and take it all away so conscientiousness actually only works intelligently in societies that have some medium to long term stability you know because you can get wiped out by hyperinflation too because hyperinflation kills off the conscientious people the people who accrued debts are thrilled with hyperinflation kicks in because it wipes out their debts but of course those debts are things they older people who were conscientious enough to save it might be that the sense of meaning that life can provide to you is proportionate to the amount of responsibility you decide to take on not that would be very strange if it was the case you know because responsibility of course is a kind of weight obviously and it's difficult to take on responsibility but if any positive emotion that you feel and your control of anxiety and the control over pain is dependent on the activation of these systems that watch you move towards a desired goal then the more complete and weighty the goal is the more kicked there's going to be in the observation that you're moving towards it and you know you kind of already know this because you'll you'll have observed in your own life that when you're engaged in something that you believe in that the time passes properly you know you can see this even if you're maybe you're reading a paper and it's actually related in some intelligible manner to something that you want to learn so even though it's difficult you get engaged in it you can remember it better you can process it better and you don't you know it's so likely to fall asleep and you're not so likely to want to find distractions all of that you can get into it and it would be very interesting if that was proportionate to the degree of responsibility that you're willing to shoulder and I think you can make a strong case for that I've also often wondered imagine you could offer people a choice here's the choice you could say well your life isn't meaningful the nihilists have got it right there's no meaning in your life and because of that there's no reason for you to accept any responsibility so you can live a responsibility free life and maybe one of the impulsive pleasure-seeking but a responsibility free life but the price you pay is that it doesn't get to be meaningful or you could say to someone not we're gonna do the opposite we're gonna say you can live a meaningful life but it's only going to be as meaningful as the amount of responsibility that you're willing to bear and then you might say well what would people choose because everybody also always makes noises about wanting to have a meaningful life but if the price you pay for that is the adoption of respond ability that it's not so obvious that people would choose meaning over you know over pointless pursuits if they had to if the benefit they got for choosing the pointless pursuits was that they really didn't have to care about anything they ever did as the situation degenerates then people have to be offered stupid amusements more and more frequently in order to for them to ignore what's actually going on in the

344,"[Music]  from a woman winning a million dollars and not telling her husband about it two people that won big and blew it all on cars and drugs we take a look at 15 stupid lottery winners number 15 Denise Rosie when Denise Rosie won the California lotto to the tune of 1.3 million dollars she did not wish to share it with her then husband Thomas she left her husband without a word of her winning and despite him thinking that something was fishy Thomas agreed for a divorce as fate would have it Thomas came about the truth and filed a lawsuit against ex wife Denise now since we all know that greed never pays it's no surprise that Thomas won the case and without even purchasing a lotto ticket the lucky guy got every single cent of his ex-wife's winnings number 14 Michael Carroll when Michael Carroll won the 2002 jackpot in England he quickly came to be known as the lotto lout he went on a crazy binge of purchasing houses and cars as expected of most lotto winners but he took his overindulgence a tad bit too far when he used the backyards of those very same houses as open areas to hold demolition derbies that featured the cars he had bought we already know that he would end up in jail and end up penniless soon enough that's exactly what happened enough said number 13 Etta may or kuu heart California's Etta may or kuu heart after playing the lottery for over 18 years actually won the jackpot she was hit by a fit of nerves as she couldn't stop shaking when she went to claim her prize she asked her son Ronny to sign the ticket and claim the jackpot on her behalf greed however can overpower even the closest of relations and to ed his disbelief Ronny claimed the jackpot as his own and went on a spending spree with the money he had claimed number 12 Timothy Elliot Timothy Elliot had always wanted to win the lottery at any cost and he was caught in an armed robbery once which he only undertook in order to get money to buy lottery tickets during his trial for the same he was diagnosed with schizoid personality disorder and hence the court put him on probation with mandatory mental counselling instead of sending him to jail the terms of his probation were the usual no drugs no gambling and no getting into any trouble when he finally lucked out in 2011 and won his million dollars he was arraigned for breaking the terms of his probation thankfully the court asked him to make a moderate restitution and let him keep the rest of his winnings number 11 Ian Gault hrus we have heard about all the stories out there where lottery winners have misplaced their winning tickets only to have to go on a massive treasure hunt to retrieve them most of them claim to have rifled through their trash retrace their steps and even went so far to turn their houses upside down and search for them Ian gouges an engineer from Merseyside faced the very same emotions when he realized that he had lost his winning 1 million pound lottery ticket how did he know for sure well because he had purchased another ticket for his girlfriend and it was just one digit away from his which of course turned out to be the winning one when he had lost him number 10 Americo Lopes greed is always the precursor for a case of breach of ethics and that's what happened with Americo Lopes construction company worker Americo was delighted when he won the lottery in 2010 he immediately quit his job on the pretext that he required foot surgery while none of this appeared suspicious for a person who had just won Millions it was only months later when his co-workers filed a lawsuit against him that things became clearer it seems that all the workers in the company usually pooled their money together in order to buy lottery tickets and it was on one such cash pool that yielded the winning ticket number 9 Vivian Nicholson of course everyone that wins a lottery jackpot wants to spend and spend and spend and when Britain's Vivian Nicholson won the lottery in 1961 her very very public exclamations that she was going to spend it all seemed very apt but of course no one thought that the lady would literally go ahead with her plans to such an extent that would run through her millions in just a matter of years rather than keeping aside some of the cash for rainy days or investing at least part of it on her future Vivian blew it all on how to tour Vivian was soon jobless alienated from her friends and a widow number 8 William Budd post William Budd post was unfortunately the victim of the common phenomenon that lottery winners have to go through family members coming out of the woodwork assuming that they are entitled to a chunk of the cash for no reason other than that they're related when post 116 point 2 million in the lottery his girlfriend sued him for some of his winnings actually winning her case his brother attempted to hire a hitman to kill him so that he could get the money for himself it was unsuccessful but still crazy his other siblings persuaded him to make bad investments that left him 1 million dollars in debt and living off Social Security checks at the time of his death number 7 Jeffrey Dampier Jeffrey Dampier had good intentions with his money he really did once he won about 20 million dollars from the Illinois Lottery he actually invested it in a gourmet popcorn store called Cassie's gourmet popcorn his sister-in-law along with her boyfriend who undoubtedly had dollar signs in his eyes shot Dan Pierre in the back of the head with a shotgun seven years after he won and then left him in the back of a van intending to take his money they were obviously caught however and convicted of murder and now they're both in jail for life number 6 Alex a sope Alex is Soak won about $500,000 in the lottery to benefit his nonprofit organization a group that aided victims of sexual abuse but Alex's soap was a sexual offender himself he molested two girls under the age of 13 one in 1993 and one in 2000 and no one actually knew this until he won the jackpot and the media dug up the info not too long later a soap was attacked while walking down the street and hit repeatedly in the head with a pipe that left him severely injured number 5 Evelyn Adams winning the lottery once is one thing the odds are astronomical at best normally if it does happen to a person it never happens again for Evelyn Adams of New Jersey however it did happen twice in 1985 and 1986 she won about 5.4 million in total and instead of thinking that maybe it was a sign that she should put it away or invest it in something Adams thought it'd be a great idea to spend it all gambling in nearby Atlantic City a little over 20 years later she found herself broke in living in a less than lavish trailer park number 4 honda lynn former Waffle House waitress Honda Lynne thought she could easily get away with keeping her millions from being shared with two of her waitress colleagues when the three of them had verbally agreed to share the winnings if any of them ever won from tickets that they got his gifts from the joints patrons since verbal agreements related to gambling do not hold up in court she did win the case that her colleagues filed against her number three Callie Rogers when Callie Rogers was 16 she was just another normal teen living in the UK then she won the lottery about 1.9 million if you're currently thinking that 16 is far too young to be dealing with that much money at once you are completely right because shortly after receiving her cash prize Callie went on a spending spree and threw her hardly hard-earned cash at everything from clothes to vacations to parties to breast enhancements oh and cocaine lots and lots of cocaine which is a pretty expensive drug so you can kind of see why she's on this list number two Jeanette Lee when the 52 year old wig shop owner from st. Louis Jeanette Lee won 18 million dollars in 1993 she initially spent it on all the usual stuff later though she went on a philanthropic binge that went unchecked still she had lost everything and had to file for bankruptcy the South Korean immigrant took her donations to educational programs community services and political organizations a tad bit too far number one Amanda Clayton Amanda Clayton was arrested for welfare fraud when it came to everyone's noticed that she'd still been collecting her welfare checks even when she had a million dollars in her bank account you either have to be too greedy to give up on welfare coupons even though you're rich now or too stupid to notice the welfare coupons you still continue to get she got five years in jail but that didn't kill her though a drug overdose did what would you do if you won the lottery let us know in the comments down below  you",0
471,how many times have you done an exercise and then as soon as you finish you feel pain you might feel it in your lower back or your shoulders but you find yourself thinking did I do something wrong or does this exercise just suck well in reality it isn't always you there are a lot of exercise out there that are plain bad for you and they only continue to exist just because they've been passed down from one misinformed gym bro to the next and no one's been smart enough to realize that these common exercises are no good so today we're going over 10 exercises that all men should avoid and these exercises aren't only exclusive to men women should avoid these exercises as well it's just that in this video we'll be sticking to exercises that I usually find men doing wrong the very first one I want to start with is actually a group of exercises that guys are drawn to like moths to a flame I'm talking about all the selector Iser ab machines at your local gym the machines that you usually start by sitting down pulling out the pins selecting your weight then grabbing some handles behind your head and doing some crunches these machines are not only a waste of time but they're also very dangerous for your lower back all these selector eyes are ab machines are locked into a range of motion meaning that your joints and your discs can't travel down their natural path you can only travel down the path that the machine has set for you even if you somehow adjust the machine to your body perfectly which by the way is very hard to do but even if you somehow had a machine custom-built for your body you can still easily run into lower back issues because you're still locked in a range of motion throughout the entire exercise besides a greater potential for a lower back injury you will also get significantly less results from these machines and if you just stick to regular ab exercises like crunches and sit-ups hanging knee tucks and decline sit-ups the reason is once again due to the fact that you're locked into a range of motions the cores main responsibility is stabilization and it's important to improve your functional core strength because your core isn't only responsible for stabilizing your trunk and your torso but it also stabilizes your whole body it's the bridge that connects your lower body to your upper body when you're locked in a range of motion you take all the stabilization normally required for ab exercises out of the movement the really ironic part is that those abdominal stabilizer muscles that you're not working with these machines they're very important to strengthen in order to prevent the lower back injuries that you'll likely experience on one of these machines do the fact that you're not working your stabilizers you're missing out on all those deep tissue abdominal muscles like your transverse abdominis and you're only targeting mostly your rectus abdominus which is the very outer layer six-pack looking muscle the transverse abdominis is very important to work on because not only does it help prevent injury but it also pulls your stomach in keeping everything nice and tight and giving you that flat stomach look if you really want to make your ab exercises tougher use weights by simply holding a dumbbell or a plate either behind your head or across your chest while doing regular traditional ab exercises once again if you don't know exactly where to start start with exercises like stability ball crunches decline sit-ups and hanging knee tucks the next exercise you should avoid is the behind the head shoulder press first off there's absolutely no advantage to going behind your head none even though I'm sure some old-school guys will be disagreeing with me in the comments below you can research this yourself and you'll find when you go behind the head you're still targeting the same muscles that you would normally target if you went in front of your head and there's no advantage when going behind your head that'll allow you to for example build more shoulder muscle faster instead what will happen when you go behind your head is you'll be putting your shoulders in a very compromised position to go behind your head you're gonna have to externally rotate your arms outward putting your rotator cuff in a very unstable and weak position this will immediately require you to lower the weight that you're using for your shoulders this already creates a huge disadvantage when compared with just going in front of your head with a heavier weight by lifting a heavier weight in front of your head you'll get more strength improvements and more muscle gains over time on top of that in that compromised position that has no advantage you're very likely to hurt your rotator cuff most people already have very tight protracted shoulders because sitting slouched over all day to compensate for a lack of shoulder flexibility and mobility people that try this exercise will bend their neck forward to get the bar behind their head increasing the risk of injury not only to your shoulder joint but also to the neck joint and again keep in mind the guys that you see performing this old-school exercise at the gym are doing it for no reason because there are no proven benefits for going behind the head only risks and disadvantages so when you do your presses simply keep the barbell in front of your face the whole time trust me your shoulders and your neck will thank you and you'll also see much more results next up is the smith machine and yes the smith machine itself can be used effectively as a supplement to your workout but the way that most guys use it is wrong and should be avoided a perfect example is using the smith machine for squats many guys believe that by sticking to the smith machine for most of their compound lifts like squats and presses they'll help prevent an injury with the smith machine due to the fact that it looks like a barbell in a squat rack it's very easy to forget that it's not a free weight exercise meaning it does not have a free range of motion at all just like most other select riser equipment it's locked into a range of motion which like I said earlier will immediately take the stabilization benefits away from whatever exercise you do when using the Smith machine specifically with the Smith machine squat you're putting yourself into a very unnatural squatting pattern first of all the whole time that you'll be doing the exercise you'll be leaning your weight back this would be impossible to do with a regular barbell because you would simply fall backwards rather than allowing your back to bend as you come down your back is forced to stay perfectly straight which to most beginners might make it seem like you would decrease the risk of a back injury but it only increases it especially because your hips are also not allowed to freely move throughout this movement a squat is a very natural movement that was performed daily before the invention of things like toilets during a squat your hips and your back should be allowed to curve and then around its natural range of motion this exercise on the other hand creates a very unnatural range of motion that you should avoid do regular barbell or dumbbell squats with proper form instead another exercise that men should avoid is one that I actually find women doing even more than men the hip abduction and adduction machines there is no natural movement that would load your hips with the kind of heavy weight that you'll be lifting on these machines in that movement pattern this machine is known for causing serious lower back injuries because it's not normal to lift a heavy load in that position these muscles are normally simply used to stabilize the body when you stand walk or run however almost everybody I've ever seen use these machines at the gym is super proud of the heavy weight load they're able to lift in this very unnatural position if you're really concerned about working your adductors and your abductors then perform exercises with resistance bands while standing rather than using these two seriously dangerous machines another very dangerous machine for your spine is the seated torso rotation machine this is the exercise where you stick your knees in between two pads and twist your lower body left and right to work your obliques supposedly the problem with this is that when you rotate your spine your hips are designed to rotate as well once again due to the fact that the machine is locked into a range of motion your hips cannot rotate properly putting excessive pressure on your spine you're a lot more likely to end up with a messed up back rather than a nice set of abs when doing this machine there are many far better ways that you could work your obliques without risking a back injury such as cable Wood chops and side planks next up is the upright row to perform this exercise you would usually use a barbell with an overhand grip and raise the bar up towards your chin with your elbows flaring out the problem with the upright row is that as you come up your arms rotate internally more and more to complete the movement due to this internal rotation in combination with this usually being a heavy weight bearing exercise many people experience a shoulder injury or impingement when doing this exercise in fact even performing this exercise correctly will immediately put you into an impingement position because it has the rotator cuff moving in an on actual way especially when you add weight to the movement physical therapists will put you in a very similar position to the upright row to test for impingement so you don't want to be doing an exercise designed to test for impingement especially not for reps and sets with a heavy weight load over time it can and will lead to an overuse injury also there are far more effective exercises with far fewer risks involved first off you can raise your hands above your elbows as you come up for this exercise rather than having your elbows above your hands if you want to work on the front and the lateral head of your shoulders regular lateral raises will usually give you more than an upright row without the risk if you want to strictly work on the front of your shoulder then you could lean back in a bench and do incline frontal raises and for the traps you could do things like clean and presses and snatches all of these exercises can provide more benefit without the risk involved with upright rows the next problematic exercise is the lap pull down behind the head too many guys in the gym must be thinking that their Rocky Balboa or something when they rep it out with this exercise the lap pull down behind the head is bad for all the same reasons that make behind the head shoulder press is bad once again just to get the bar behind your head you're going to increase the chances of a rotator cuff injury because you need to rotate your arms externally as far as they can go again due to the fact that most people already have a lack of flexibility in their shoulders you'll also increase the risk of injury to not only your shoulders but also to your neck and finally the nail in the coffin is that once again you won't be able to lift as much weight as a regular lat pulldown meaning you'll be building less strength and less muscle over time while risking unnecessary shoulder and neck injuries this is once again another exercise with nothing but disadvantages hmm who would have ever thought that when an exercise has done the right way the way the exercise is meant to be done you get more results the next one that I want to go over I already know is going to make a lot of people in the comment section mad but I want to help all of you avoid an injury so let's talk about the leg press machine the leg press machine is very bad mechanically for your body because it does not allow your muscles and your joints to perform in a functional manner and it puts a huge amount of stress on your knees and your lower back when you naturally lift weight with your legs your back is allowed to move freely but on the leg press your back is pinned against the pad because once again you're in a lock range of motion it has very similar problems as performing the smith machine squats some people are actually able to get away with doing this exercise without too much of an issue but I've also seen an equal amount of people hurt their lower backs because your back winds up in an awkward flex position the whole time regular barbell squats walking lunges deadlifts split squats and a number of other leg exercises are far more effective and functional than this one so I recommend that you stick to those whenever possible speaking of useless leg exercises you should also avoid leg extensions and leg curls unless you're rehabbing an injury or unless you're looking to be a body builder these two exercises don't serve much of a purpose they're not functional they put excess stress on your knee and there are far better alternatives that can help you build more functional leg muscle in less time they also isolate the knee joint which is very unnatural because whenever you normally work your knee joint in real life you're also working your hip joint the worst part is that all the strength that you build from this exercise cannot be applied mechanically to most movements that you would encounter in real life the last exercise that I want you to look out for is the back hyperextension machine even though there is a safer way to perform this exercise a lot of the people that do it do it completely wrong and they wind up hurting the lower back in the process the spine is not meant to extend past the point of neutral at any time with this exercise so many people extend their backs past that point on every rep that they come up and they wind up with a strain lower back or a full-out injury to their discs even when doing this exercise properly you could still hurt your lower back just by performing reps with a weight held against your chest for that reason if you do try this exercise be very careful and start with just your body weight to avoid a lower back injury that's it guys I really hope this video has helped you out if you enjoyed it make sure you subscribe to this channel for

391,hi I'm Ben and this is the house I built out of shipping containers now I've been interested in shipping container architecture for quite some time but I had a really hard time finding good information about how to get building permits or how much would it cost well we did the research we documented everything that we did and now we're so excited to share with you what we learned so check it out this is episode 2 where we'll show you how we move the containers cut them open and started the structural reinforcement after letting the concrete cure for three days we began stripping the molds and getting ready for the day I was most excited about which is crane day this is the single biggest piece of equipment that we rented for this project and it's basically like a giant transformer to pick up the containers they use these fabric straps which are super strong and each one of them has a hook which can hook into the boxes at the corner of the containers we started by moving one the extra 20-foot containers that I bought to store tools and materials on site this is a specialty type of container that opens up not just on the short sides but on the broad side as well next we started moving the other 20-foot container which is going to be the guest bedroom and bathroom this container is lightweight enough that the crane could actually drive while the box was suspended in the air  we had to line up the container so that it wouldn't break one of the drain pipes that was sticking through the concrete  next up was a 40-foot container which is too heavy to drive with so what they did is he just would pick it up swing the arm around to get it closer and then reposition the crane and do the whole thing again we put some blue painters tape on the corners of the concrete foundation just to give us a mark to aim for the second 40-foot container had too far this distance to travel and it's sort of like watching an inchworm sort of move its way across the desert  it took a few attempts and three guys pushing on the corners to get it in the right location now if I was designing this again I would now know that it's possible to get it not exactly where you want it but within about half an inch crane day was a lot of fun but now it's time to turn these steel boxes into a house we started pulling up the floors on the containers now these floors are made out of plywood that is about one in the eighth of an inch thick the steel structure underneath and underside of this plywood is coated with a thick black tar-like substance which is there for waterproofing and they keep the steel from rusting the majority of the plumbing for this house is going to go in this layer right amongst all the steel beams and of course things never line up properly so we're gonna have to cut out a few of them now the pipe that Robert the plumber is working around is going to be the main drain that goes out from the container to the septic tank [Music] originally we had left us a lot longer but once we saw that it wasn't going to align perfectly with the structure inside the container we had to cut it down so it wouldn't break when we drop the container into place this meant that Robert would have to use a jackhammer to expose a little bit of the pipe by removing some of the concrete so we'd have enough room to fit an elbow on it now when I first learned we'd have to do this I was worried it would take a really long time but it actually only took about 45 minutes we then cut holes into other beams so that we could run the smaller drain pipes which will receive the water from the bathroom sink the shower the toilet and the kitchen sink the cut edges of the steel are quite sharp so the plumbers put some twenty minute hot mud and spray foam in between the pipes and the steel beams just to keep the pipes from sliding around and potentially getting damaged now wherever you have drains you also need to have venting pipes and these go all the way up through the walls and out the roof now the black ABS pipe is fine for wastewater going out of the building but for all the clean water coming in we want to use copper this was more time-consuming because the copper has to be sweated with a torch whereas the ABS plastic pipe can just be glued together now in the floor areas that don't have pipes going through them we started filling those places in with rigid insulation we packed in two layers of 2-inch thick rigid insulation and then use spray foam to seal up all the gaps even though this insulation has excellent r-value it's not going to be super effective in this location because the conductivity of the metal is going to create a thermal bridge around it but still we added it in to keep that space full keep critters out of it and to just give us a little bit of extra thermal protection this foam insulation cuts pretty easily with a box cutter so we just cut pieces that would also fit around all the pipes after sealing it all with spray foam and testing to make sure the pipes are watertight we then put the floorboards back on this insulation is just so we can cover up the floors and get to work on the frame we'll show the full insulation details including how we did continuous insulation over this plywood in next week's episode while the rest of the crew was working on the insulation and the floors I began making the structural frames for the doors and windows after double-checking the dimensions of the windows I began making the 45-degree cuts so that I can make a mitered frame the shipping container gets its strength from the continuous corrugated panels so whenever you cut one of these panels you have to reinforce it for these first few windows I decided to use two inch tube steel it works great and is plenty strong but as you see for some of the later frames I switched to angle sections no I did all the welding for the doors and windows using this little Forney welder it's an inexpensive machine that's easy to use great for beginners and powerful enough to build a house with and now for the moment of truth I was ready to cut into the container for the first time now it was pretty nervous about this because you know I paid a reasonable amount of money for these things and we'd spent all this time to get them in the right position so I really didn't want to screw this up I drew out the square that I'm gonna cut out that will allow the frame to fit in using a silver sharpie a level and a piece of cardboard so I could draw straight lines around the corrugation we didn't have electricity from the grid available on the construction site so I set up one of my little goals zero Power Packs with a solar panel and that was enough to keep my batteries for my battery-powered angle grinder nice and charged now I've seen people cut containers open using a plasma cutter but I'm really accurate with the angle grinder it's a much easier tool to use and less expensive I just went slow made sure that was following along the lines I went through quite a few discs but it only took about an hour and a half to cut out this entire window the paint on these containers is really thick so I wire brushed it away to expose the bare steel in preparation for welding I needed a way to hold the frame in place while I welded the frame to the corrugated metal so I built these sliding supports out of two by fours that would allow me to clamp the two by fours to the corrugation and hold the frame nice and flush to the corrugation this is important because when you cut into these big panels of corrugated metal they can bow and flex quite a bit with this technique it's pretty important that the hole you cut into corrugated metal is just the right size because you don't want to be having to bridge across with the welder to connect the pieces you don't have to do continuous seams all the way around I just tried to get about two to three inch welds about every six to eight inches I screwed up an over cut on this piece but I just filled it in with my welder  you  the second one went a lot smoother I took more time in making sure that my initial drawing on the container was perfect and I went a lot slower with the cutting as well making sure to stay right on the line it was about a hundred and twenty degrees inside these steel boxes and cutting open the window was a great experience not only get to see the view but you get this rush of cooler just a hundred and five degree air coming in  you  it's definitely worth it to go really slow and get your initial cut out as accurate as possible the welding for the second one was a lot easier because I wasn't bridging as big of a gap between the frame and the corrugated steel on the first window I ended up making seams that were a little bit too long on the second one I kind of got it right and was sticking to seams that were just about 2 to 3 inches long if he try to weld seams that are too long and continuous the heat buildup from all the welding can start to deform and Bend the corrugated metal  for the two big 10 foot long by folding doors I wanted a frame that was a little bit stronger so I went with 3 inch by 2 inch tube steel  I glued some blocks of wood to the underside of a steel square and then I used that to clamp my tube steel pieces at nice right angles I learned that grinding things once they're installed is a little bit more difficult especially if you have to get up on a ladder so I made sure to grind out all my wells as I welded them  now the frames for the doors don't need a bottom piece but I didn't want to move this without one because it might Bend so I just welded in a temporary support I also didn't cut the vertical pieces to length until I had welded the whole thing together this way I can make sure that both sides were even working close to the ground is great because you can keep everything nice and flat but it did make it so that we'd have to flip the frames over in order to cut all the way through from the other side with the angle grinder  first frame is done time to make a second one exactly the same for these big doors we started cutting out the openings from the inside since it was easier to get up on a ladder with the nice flat floor black sharpie lines showed up real strong against the light beige interiors so it was easier to cut from the inside because I could see the line really crisply even through all the sweat and fog on the safety glasses no matter what side you're in though it's easier to cut the part of the corrugation that's closest to you so I did do some of it outside as well it's also easier to cut real close and flush to the support beam from the outside because from the inside it's hard to get the angle grinder at the right angle because the floor gets in the way now one thing to be careful for is that when you're cutting the container the walls are under some pressure and all of a sudden every once in a while they will jump or move and this can pinch the angle grinder or snap off a blade these big pieces of metal are bendy heavy and have jagged edges so it's a little bit tricky to handle them without cutting yourself up  some containers have welded on steel loops that are used to strap down cargo I just cut these out as well the corrugated metal was welded to this base beam along the container I switched to a heavier angle grinder and just ground this all down I stripped away the paint in preparation for welding and we lifted this 10 foot by 7 foot frame into place remembering the lesson from the windows about bridging the gaps we cut a little bit more on the conservative side and it wasn't quite big enough so we just ground the way until the frame fit in perfectly we started by tacking the frame to the base beam at the bottom corner and then slowly worked our way up making sure everything was still level the three inch wide tube steel was a lot easier to weld to the corrugation than the two inch steel because there was just a lot more surface area to connect the welds to and the radius of the tube steel wasn't sloping away from the corrugation as soon as I got the frame packed in and secured to the container I cut away the temporary support in retrospect I should have welded this about six inches higher than I did just to give myself a little bit more room to cut it off  so while I was welding in the first frame the guys started cutting the opening for the second one now you might think that shipping containers are quite strong and don't need any additional structural support but that's not actually the case if you're doing a fully permitted code approved building our structural engineer had to design an interior support system out of to buy lumber and plywood that would meet all the structural requirements from the permitting office this required substantial headers over these large by folding doors we were figuring this out as we went along and we knew that the doors and windows would be the trickiest parts so we were made sure to frame round those and get that all set relative to the drawings before filling in all the wall spaces around them once you have the key structural elements in place using a nail gun to add in two by fours isn't too hard  on most of the projects that I have been involved with the header is directly over the door itself but in this case the header has to be tied in to the square steel tube that runs along the upper length of the container and so therefore we had to push the header up and then frame out underneath it the purpose of the header is to provide support over large doors or windows you don't want deflection down on to these frames which neither cause them to break or it could make them very difficult to open the frame we was going pretty quickly but nothing was really tied into the container yet except for the 2x4 that runs along the bottom of the wall that was attached to the plywood that is part of the container floor  the stretches of walls that don't have doors in windows or plumbing features went a lot faster because we could panel eyes and build the walls and sections outside we could then drag these into the container and then shoot nails down through this bottom 2x4 or sill plate and into the plywood deck below now I've had a lot of people ask why any sort of additional structure is needed I mean aren't these steel boxes shouldn't they be strong enough by themselves the problem isn't that these boxes aren't strong enough it's where they get their strength and it's from these continuous corrugated panels that strength is compromised when we cut into them even though we are reinforcing where we cut but the more important problem is that this steel is exposed to the outside and it's only about 1/8 of an inch thick if you're relying on exterior steel that's relatively thin for the structural support of the building if someone doesn't maintain the paint and it starts to rust out the whole building could collapse you don't really want buildings that can have structural failures just due to owner neglect the most annoying part of the framing was attaching the walls to the steel containers we nailed these galvanized steel brackets to a 2x4 and then nail this on top of the walls to create a double top plate and then drive self-tapping screws through the holes in the brackets and into the square steel tube that runs along the top of the container now putting this many self-tapping screws into steel is not fun and this took a minute our walls are taller than 8 feet and we're gonna have to add plywood sheathing so we added an additional pieces of 2x4 in between the studs so we'd have a surface for nailing on the plywood  the ceiling will be supported by two by fours on joist hangers we didn't nail into two by fours yet because we still have to add insulation and sprinkler systems and other things but we just cut them and set them in place for now so to recap we have a two by four at the bottom vertical two by fours with stiffeners some additional pieces for attaching the plywood and eventually drywall hangers to support the two by force that will support the ceiling a double top plate with brackets attached to the container  another tricky structural requirement was that we had to tie down some of the shear walls to the foundation we have to have a steel rod coming up from the concrete now we can get in there one of two ways we can either cast it in place and use a coupling nut or we can drill a hole and epoxy it in there but in either case it has to come up through the container through a top plate where this galvanized steel bracket can be bolted to it and then that bracket can be attached to a four by six or four by four post so Tony wrestled with that but we didn't want to lock the post in place until we knew how the window installation would go after cleaning all the welds with wire brush and then sprayed a few coats of rusty metal primer over the welds the exposed steel that I brushed away on the container and the frames themselves we ran a heavy B decock around the inside of the frame and then press the window into place the nailing flange on the window is going right up against the inside of the frame and then we drove self tapping screws through the flange and into the steel frame now this wouldn't be an ideal building detail in anything but a dry climate like this because you really have to rely on the silicone caulk from the exterior between the window unit and the steel frame to be your rain protection with the window in place Tony then felt comfortable adding in the post  so here's how the whole aiming for this end wall looks we have a steel rod going into the foundation that attaches to a bracket that connects to a post which is tied into the rest of the 2x4 framing I recommend drilling holes in using anchoring epoxy to fix two steel rods into the concrete it's way easier than trying to cast them in perfectly now you may have noticed that the part of the floor that the steel rod went through was steel and that's because this is part of the container where forklifts can come in to lift up the container from the end you may notice that our building details are different throughout the project and that's because we were learning as we went the frames I made out a tube steel for the first set of doors and windows work just fine but I noticed that it was very difficult to hold them perfectly in place and it was a really unforgiving detail where you had to cut the window hole perfect so for the next set of doors he used angle steel to make the frames this way I would have a flange that could catch on the hole in the container which would make it easier for clamping getting it straight and it would give us a little bit of a overlapping connection where we could caulk it from both sides I used an angle grinder to notch out the ends of these pieces of angle steel so it did fit together and have a nice flat flange  these frames are going to reinforce the openings for the swinging entry doors [Applause] welded the corners added a temporary support piece and then flip the frame over and welded from the other side the 20-foot container which is going to house the guest bedroom has two swinging doors that are parallel to each other that's going to create opportunities for cross ventilation my buddy Eric was visiting so we had ourselves a dueling angle grinder situation Eric is a really talented metal worker and be sure to check out his work I'll put a link to his Instagram in the description box below I feel like this is a much better way to frame the doors and windows not only does the flange catch nicely on the corrugation it actually gives you a really clean aesthetic from the outside as well you also get two different areas to weld the frame to the corrugated metal on the outside you weld right along the opening but on the inside you're welding the edge of the flange to the surface of the corrugated metal  it's also nice because it gives us to seems to call one on the inside and one on the outside I'll show finish drawings of the different window framing details next week as I show how I finished trimming out all the windows and doors and also in the next episode of the modern home project will show how we did the insulation install the doors and windows and start having a little bit of fun along the way  be sure to check out the first episode and don't forget to subscribe and turn on notifications  you  oh yeah and our new website

561,what's up guys I want to talk about how to roll up an extension cord one of my biggest pet peeves is when people roll my extension cords and what I see a lot okay there's people doing this all right so roll up extension cord like this is fine if you have one or if you have a whole bunch of hooks for every single one of your extension cords what you have at the end when you're all done okay one now I'm dirty okay my clothes or whatever and then two I have to put this big thing on a hook and you can only put it on one hook and then at the end of the day you're trying to get everything out and you're doing this and then when you're trying to unroll it you have you know 100 frickin little rolls in order to get it out or you can try to throw it but then you get it wind up with a tangled mess another thing I see people doing which just bothers me to no end is when they do this little gimmicky thing all right and I think it's so cool that at the end of it you can sit there grab it and everything pulls out now I only did a little bit imagine an entire cord this big how are you suppose to store this alright I mean it's just it's ridiculous and it's annoying alright now the proper way to roll up a cord is to let it hang straight ahead like this okay you get six foot length or somewhat six foot lengths it's very it's much faster than rolling around your arm much cleaner and the trick it's at the end see this is this right here wound up from the me rolling around my arm so if you're always winding up with all these curves and stuff like that you're doing it yourself by rolling around your arm that won't happen if you do it my way all right so now I'm getting to the end okay so I have one more loop to go all right so I was trying to figure out the words to explain you come over you have one more loop left okay you grab it and you drop so basically that's two loops again you come over I have I know this is gonna be my last loop so I hold this come over here drop and basically drop it now what you do did you grab this and you wrap it okay now that's gonna be the hard part stick your hand in the hole you grab it now you can put a whole bunch chords by hooking it now if that's one more time I'm gonna do it again alright so you understand what just happened when I wrapped it around okay I stick my hand in the hole grabbed it now this right here is never gonna go in that hole I pull it push it through now I can sit there and put a whole bunch of things a whole bunch of cords on there now when I take it apart it's very easy put your hand in unravel it you take the one end let me see this is where my plug is I plug it in and then I just walk to wherever I want to go so one more time I'm here this is my last one basically you just drop it so you have a long one wrap it around now if you don't want to do all that at least in the least just grab this and put it through the hole and hang it that's probably the simplest way of doing it I like mine to be clean and I'm anal so I like it to be in the middle but I mean all right so if you like tips and tricks subscribe to the channel I do these all the time things that I find make my life easier I'm going to share like storing chords so uh put it through the hole so I'll hit the like button makes feel good hook a brother Subscribe,0
105,"Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. There's a famous way to seemingly create chocolate out of nothing. Maybe you've seen it before. This chocolate bar is 4 squares by 8 squares, but if you cut it like this and then like this and finally like this you can rearrange the pieces like so and wind up with the same 4 by 8 bar but with a leftover piece, apparently created out of thin air. There's a popular animation of this illusion as well. I call it an illusion because it's just that. Fake. In reality, the final bar is a bit smaller. It contains this much less chocolate. Each square along the cut is shorter than it was in the original, but the cut makes it difficult to notice right away. The animation is extra misleading, because it tries to cover up its deception. The lost height of each square is surreptitiously added in while the piece moves to make it hard to notice. I mean, come on, obviously you cannot cut up a chocolate bar and rearrange the pieces into more than you started with. Or can you? One of the strangest theorems in modern mathematics is the Banach-Tarski paradox. It proves that there is, in fact, a way to take an object and separate it into 5 different pieces. And then, with those five pieces, simply rearrange them. No stretching required into two exact copies of the original item. Same density, same size, same everything. Seriously. To dive into the mind blow that it is and the way it fundamentally questions math and ourselves, we have to start by asking a few questions. First, what is infinity? A number? I mean, it's nowhere on the number line, but we often say things like there\'s an infinite ""number"" of blah-blah-blah. And as far as we know, infinity could be real. The universe may be infinite in size and flat, extending out for ever and ever without end, beyond even the part we can observe or ever hope to observe. That's exactly what infinity is. Not a number per se, but rather a size. The size of something that doesn't end. Infinity is not the biggest number, instead, it is how many numbers there are. But there are different sizes of infinity. The smallest type of infinity is countable infinity. The number of hours in forever. It's also the number of whole numbers that there are, natural number,  the numbers we use when counting things, like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and so on. Sets like these are unending, but they are countable. Countable means that you can count them from one element to any other in a finite amount of time, even if that finite amount of time is longer than you will live or the universe will exist for, it's still finite. Uncountable infinity, on the other hand, is literally bigger. Too big to even count. The number of real numbers that there are, not just whole numbers, but all numbers is uncountably infinite. You literally cannot count even from 0 to 1 in a finite amount of time by naming every real number in between. I mean, where do you even start? Zero, okay. But what comes next? 0.000000... Eventually, we would imagine a 1 going somewhere at the end, but there is no end. We could always add another 0. Uncountability makes this set so much larger than the set of all whole numbers that even between 0 and 1, there are more numbers than there are whole numbers on the entire endless number line. Georg Cantor's famous diagonal argument helps illustrate this. Imagine listing every number between zero and one. Since they are uncountable and can't be listed in order, let's imagine randomly generating them forever with no repeats. Each number regenerate can be paired with a whole number. If there's a one to one correspondence between the two, that is if we can match one whole number to each real number on our list, that would mean that countable and uncountable sets are the same size. But we can't do that, even though this list goes on for ever. Forever isn't enough. Watch this. If we go diagonally down our endless list of real numbers and take the first decimal of the first number and the second of the second number, the third of the third and so on and add one to each, subtracting one if it happens to be a nine, we can generate a new real number that is obviously between 0 and 1, but since we've defined it to be different from every number on our endless list and at least one place it's clearly not contained in the list. In other words, we've used up every single whole number, the entire infinity of them and yet we can still come up with more real numbers. Here's something else that is true but counter-intuitive. There are the same number of even numbers as there are even and odd numbers. At first, that sounds ridiculous. Clearly, there are only half as many even numbers as all whole numbers, but that intuition is wrong. The set of all whole numbers is denser but every even number can be matched with a whole number. You will never run out of members either set, so this one to one correspondence shows that both sets are the same size. In other words, infinity divided by two is still infinity. Infinity plus one is also infinity. A good illustration of this is Hilbert's paradox up the Grand Hotel. Imagine a hotel with a countably infinite number of rooms. But now, imagine that there is a person booked into every single room. Seemingly, it's fully booked, right? No. Infinite sets go against common sense. You see, if a new guest shows up and wants a room, all the hotel has to do is move the guest in room number 1 to room number 2. And a guest in room 2 to room 3 and 3 to 4 and 4 to 5 and so on. Because the number of rooms is never ending we cannot run out of rooms. Infinity -1 is also infinity again. If one guest leaves the hotel, we can shift every guest the other way. Guest 2 goes to room 1, 3 to 2, 4 to 3 and so on, because we have an infinite amount of guests. That is a never ending supply of them. No room will be left empty. As it turns out, you can subtract any finite number from infinity and still be left with infinity. It doesn't care. It's unending. Banach-Tarski hasn't left our sights yet. All of this is related. We are now ready to move on to shapes. Hilbert's hotel can be applied to a circle. Points around the circumference can be thought of as guests. If we remove one point from the circle that point is gone, right? Infinity tells us it doesn't matter. The circumference of a circle is irrational. It's the radius times 2Pi. So, if we mark off points beginning from the whole, every radius length along the circumference going clockwise we will never land on the same point twice, ever. We can count off each point we mark with a whole number. So this set is never-ending, but countable, just like guests and rooms in Hilbert's hotel. And like those guests, even though one has checked out, we can just shift the rest. Move them counterclockwise and every room will be filled Point 1 moves to fill in the hole, point 2 fills in the place where point 1 used to be, 3 fills in 2 and so on. Since we have a unending supply of numbered points, no hole will be left unfilled. The missing point is forgotten. We apparently never needed it to be complete. There's one last needo consequence of infinity we should discuss before tackling Banach-Tarski. Ian Stewart famously proposed a brilliant dictionary. One that he called the Hyperwebster. The Hyperwebster lists every single possible word of any length formed from the 26 letters in the English alphabet. It begins with ""a,"" followed by ""aa,"" then ""aaa,"" then ""aaaa."" And after an infinite number of those, ""ab,"" then ""aba,"" then ""abaa"", ""abaaa,"" and so on until ""z, ""za,"" ""zaa,"" et cetera, et cetera, until the final entry in infinite sequence of ""z""s. Such a dictionary would contain every single word. Every single thought, definition, description, truth, lie, name, story. What happened to Amelia Earhart would be in that dictionary, as well as every single thing that didn't happened to Amelia Earhart. Everything that could be said using our alphabet. Obviously, it would be huge, but the company publishing it might realize that they could take a shortcut. If they put all the words that begin with a in a volume titled ""A,"" they wouldn\'t have to print the initial ""a."" Readers would know to just add the ""a,"" because it\'s the ""a"" volume. By removing the initial ""a,"" the publisher is left with every ""a"" word sans the first ""a,"" which has surprisingly become every possible word. Just one of the 26 volumes has been decomposed into the entire thing. It is now that we're ready to investigate this video's titular paradox. What if we turned an object, a 3D thing into a Hyperwebster? Could we decompose pieces of it into the whole thing? Yes. The first thing we need to do is give every single point on the surface of the sphere one name and one name only. A good way to do this is to name them after how they can be reached by a given starting point. If we move this starting point across the surface of the sphere in steps that are just the right length, no matter how many times or in what direction we rotate, so long as we never backtrack, it will never wind up in the same place twice. We only need to rotate in four directions to achieve this paradox. Up, down, left and right around two perpendicular axes. We are going to need every single possible sequence that can be made of any finite length out of just these four rotations. That means we will need lef, right, up and down as well as left left, left up, left down, but of course not left right, because, well, that's backtracking. Going left and then right means you're the same as you were before you did anything, so no left rights, no right lefts and no up downs and no down ups. Also notice that I'm writing the rotations in order right to left, so the final rotation is the leftmost letter. That will be important later on. Anyway. A list of all possible sequences of allowed rotations that are finite in lenght is, well, huge. Countably infinite, in fact. But if we apply each one of them to a starting point in green here and then name the point we land on after the sequence that brought us there, we can name a countably infinite set of points on the surface. Let's look at how, say, these four strings on our list would work. Right up left. Okay, rotating the starting point this way takes us here. Let's colour code the point based on the final rotation in its string, in this case it's left and for that we will use purple. Next up down down. That sequence takes us here. We name the point DD and color it blue, since we ended with a down rotation. RDR, that will be this point's name, takes us here. And for a final right rotation, let's use red. Finally, for a sequence that end with up, let's colour code the point orange. Now, if we imagine completing this process for every single sequence, we will have a countably infinite number of points named and color-coded. That's great, but not enough. There are an uncountably infinite number of points on a sphere's surface. But no worries, we can just pick a point we missed. Any point and color it green, making it a new starting point and then run every sequence from here. After doing this to an uncountably infinite number of starting point we will have indeed named and colored every single point on the surface just once. With the exception of poles. Every sequence has two poles of rotation. Locations on the sphere that come back to exactly where they started. For any sequence of right or left rotations, the polls are the north and south poles. The problem with poles like these is that more than one sequence can lead us to them. They can be named more than once and be colored in more than one color. For example, if you follow some other sequence to the north or south pole, any subsequent rights or lefts will be equally valid names. In order to deal with this we're going to just count them out of the normal scheme and color them all yellow. Every sequence has two, so there are a countably infinite amount of them. Now, with every point on the sphere given just one name and just one of six colors, we are ready to take the entire sphere apart. Every point on the surface corresponds to a unique line of points below it all the way to the center point. And we will be dragging every point's line along with it. The lone center point we will set aside. Okay, first we cut out and extract all the yellow poles, the green starting points, the orange up points, the blue down points and the red and purple left and right points. That's the entire sphere. With just these pieces you could build the whole thing. But take a look at the left piece. It is defined by being a piece composed of every point, accessed via a sequence ending with a left rotation. If we rotate this piece right, that\'s the same as adding an ""R"" to every point's name. But left and then right is a backtrack, they cancel each other out. And look what happens when you reduce them away. The set becomes the same as a set of all points with names that end with L, but also U, D and every point reached with no rotation. That's the full set of starting points. We have turned less than a quarter of the sphere into nearly three-quarters just by rotating it. We added nothing. It's like the Hyperwebster. If we had the right piece and the poles of rotation and the center point, well, we've got the entire sphere again, but with stuff left over. To make a second copy, let's rotate the up piece down. The down ups cancel because, well, it's the same as going nowhere and we're left with a set of all starting points, the entire up piece, the right piece and the left piece, but there's a problem here. We don't need this extra set of starting points. We still haven't used the original ones. No worries, let's just start over. We can just move everything from the up piece that turns into a starting point when rotated down. That means every point whose final rotation is up. Let's put them in the piece. Of course, after rotating points named UU will just turn into points named U, and that would give us a copy here and here. So, as it turns out, we need to move all points with any name that is just a string of Us. We will put them in the down piece and rotate the up piece down, which makes it congruent to the up right and left pieces, add in the down piece along with some up and the starting point piece and, well, we're almost done. The poles of rotation and center are missing from this copy, but no worries. There's a countably infinite number of holes, where the poles of rotations used to be, which means there is some pole around which we can rotate this sphere such that every pole hole orbits around without hitting another. Well, this is just a bunch of circles with one point missing. We fill them each like we did earlier. And we do the same for the centerpoint. Imagine a circle that contains it inside the sphere and just fill in from infinity and look what we've done. We have taken one sphere and turned it into two identical spheres without adding anything. One plus one equals 1. That took a while to go through, but the implications are huge. And mathematicians, scientists and philosophers are still debating them. Could such a process happen in the real world? I mean, it can happen mathematically and math allows us to abstractly predict and describe a lot of things in the real world with amazing accuracy, but does the Banach-Tarski paradox take it too far? Is it a place where math and physics separate? We still don't know. History is full of examples of mathematical concepts developed in the abstract that we did not think would ever apply to the real world for years, decades, centuries, until eventually science caught up and realized they were totally applicable and useful. The Banach-Tarski paradox could actually happen in our real-world, the only catch of course is that the five pieces you cut your object into aren't simple shapes. They must be infinitely complex and detailed. That's not possible to do in the real world, where measurements can only get so small and there's only a finite amount of time to do anything, but math says it's theoretically valid and some scientists think it may be physically valid too. There have been a number of papers published suggesting a link between by Banach-Tarski and the way tiny tiny sub-atomic particles can collide at high energies and turn into more particles than we began with. We are finite creatures. Our lives are small and can only scientifically consider a small part of reality. What's common for us is just a sliver of what's available. We can only see so much of the electromagnetic spectrum. We can only delve so deep into extensions of space. Common sense applies to that which we can access. But common sense is just that. Common. If total sense is what we want, we should be prepared to accept that we shouldn't call infinity weird or strange. The results we've arrived at by accepting it are valid, true within the system we use to understand, measure, predict and order the universe. Perhaps the system still needs perfecting, but at the end of day, history continues to show us that the universe isn't strange. We are. And as always, thanks for watching. Finally, as always, the description is full of links to learn more. There are also a number of books linked down there that really helped me wrap my mind kinda around Banach-Tarski. First of all, Leonard Wapner\'s ""The Pea and the Sun."" This book is fantastic and it\'s full of lot of the preliminaries needed to understand the proof that comes later. He also talks a lot about the ramifications of what Banach-Tarski and their theorem might mean for mathematics. Also, if you wanna talk about math and whether it's discovered or invented, whether it really truly will map onto the universe, Yanofsky's ""The Outer Limits of Reason"" is great. This is the favorite book of mine that I've read this entire year. Another good one is E. Brian Davies' ""Why Beliefs Matter."" This is actually Corn\'s favorite book, as you might be able to see there. It's delicious and full of lots of great information about the limits of what we can know and what science is and what mathematics is. If you love infinity and math, I cannot more highly recommend Matt Parker's ""Things to Make and Do in the Fourth Dimension."" He\'s hilarious and this book is very very great at explaining some pretty awesome things. So keep reading, and if you're looking for something to watch, I hope you've already watched Kevin Lieber's film on Field Day. I already did a documentary about Whittier, Alaska over there. Kevin's got a great short film about putting things out on the Internet and having people react to them. There's a rumor that Jake Roper might be doing something on Field Day soon. So check out mine, check out Kevin's and subscribe to Field Day for upcoming Jake Roper action, yeah? He's actually in this room right now, say hi, Jake. [Jake:] Hi. Thanks for filming this, by the way. Guys, I really appreciate who you all are. And as always, thanks for watching.",0

384,"Translator: Samaher AlJudaibi Auditor: Anwar Dafa-Alla Well, I want to see a show of hands How many of you canceled his friendship with someone on Facebook because they said Something offensive about politics or religion Baby care, food? (Laughter) How many of you avoid at least one person who knows it Just because you don't want to talk to them? (Laughter) You know, for a polite conversation it was usual Follow Henry Higgins' advice at Mayfair Lady: Stick to the weather and your health. But these days with climate change and the fight against vaccination (Laughter) These topics are also unsafe So this world that we live in, This is the world in which every conversation is in She has the power to turn into an argument Where politicians cannot talk to each other And even in the least important cases She finds someone who fervently fights with or against her Not normal The Pew Research Center studied 10,000 adults in America And they found that at this moment, we are more polarized And more divided Than we have ever been in history. We are less inclined to accept a settlement This means that we no longer hear each other We make decisions about where we live Who will we marry, even who will be our friends? Based on what we really think. Again, that means we don't listen to each other Conversation requires a balance between talking and listening And somewhere along the way, we lost this balance. Part of this is due to technology Smartphones that are either in your hands Or close enough so that it can be eaten quickly. According to Pew Research Center About a third of American teenagers, send more than 100 text messages a day. Many of them, most of them, are more likely to communicate text messages with their friends From having an oral conversation with them face to face There\'s a beautiful piece in ""The Atlantic"" It was written by a high school teacher named Paul Barnwell. He gave his students a contact project He wanted to teach them how to talk about one subject without using notes He said: ""I came to a realization .. (Laughter) ""I came to the realization that conversational efficiency Perhaps the most overlooked skill was our failure to teach her Everyday, children spend hours exchanging ideas with each other through screens But they rarely find the opportunity To hone the interpersonal skills of relationships and communication This question may sound funny, but we have to ask ourselves: Is there any skill in the 21st century? More important than being able to maintain a coherent and confident conversation? "" Now, I earn my living by talking to people: Nobel laureates, truck drivers, Billionaires, kindergarten teachers, Heads of state, plumbers. I talk to people I like. And I talk to people I don't like. I talk to some of the people I deeply disagree with on a personal level. But I can still have a great conversation with them. So I want to spend the next ten minutes teaching you how to talk. And how do you listen Many of you have heard a lot of advice on this Things like looking at a person directly in the eye Think of interesting topics to discuss in advance Like, shake the head in the affirmative and smile to show that you are interested Repeat or summarize what you heard So, I want you to forget all these tips Because she is stupid (Laughter) Because there is no reason to learn to show that you are attentive, alert and interested If you really care (Laughter) (clap) Currently, I am actually using the same skills as someone who conducts professional interviews As I do in normal life So, I'm going to teach you how to interview people This will really help you learn to be a better speaker Learn to have a conversation Without wasting your time, Without feeling bored And please, without offending anyone We all had a really great conversation. We did it before, and we know how it is. The kind of conversation you feel after engagement and inspiration, Or when you feel you have made a real connection Or, you have been fully understood. There is no reason Why most of our dealings are not like that. So, I have 10 basic rules. I will accompany you through every rule, But frankly, if you pick and master one of them, You will have better conversations already. The first rule: Do not multitask And here I do not mean to leave your smartphone only Or leave your mobile device, your car keys or whatever in your hand. I mean, be around. Be present at the same moment. Don't think about the argument you had with your boss Don't think about what to have for dinner If you want to get out of the conversation Exit the conversation But not half of it is present and half outside Second: Do not express your opinion as if you were an expert on the topic If you want to express your opinion Without any opportunity to respond, argue, block or grow, Write a blog. (Laughter) Now, there is a really good reason why I don't allow critics to appear on my program: Because they are really boring. If they were from the conservative party, they would hate Obama and the food stamps and abortion. If they were liberal, they would hate big banks And the oil companies, and Dick Cheney. Completely predictable. And you don't want to be like that. You want to get into the conversation assuming you have something to learn. The doctor said to the famous psychiatrist ""Scott Beck"": Real listening requires a person to set themselves aside. Sometimes that means putting your personal opinion aside. And he said, he senses this acceptance It will make the speaker become less horse And more likely to show internal mysteries For his mind to the listener. Again, suppose you have something to learn. Bill Nye said: ""Everyone you meet will know something that you don\'t know."" I put it this way: Everyone is expert about something. The third rule: use open-ended questions. In this case, this feature was taken from journalists. Start your question with whom, what, when, where, why or how. If you ask a complex question, you will get a simple answer. If I asked you, ""Did you get scared?"" You will respond to the strongest word in the sentence, It is the word ""fear"". And the answer will be ""Yes, I was afraid"" or ""No, I didn\'t hide."" ""Were you angry?"" ""Yes, I was very angry."" Let them describe it. They know what. Try to ask them questions like: ""What was that?"" "" How did you feel?"" Because after that they will have to pause for a moment to think about it. And you'll get a much more interesting response. Fourth rule: go with the current. This means that ideas will come to your mind And you need to let her out of your mind. Often times we hear interviews The guest is speaking for several minutes Then the host interrupts him with a question What seems to be out of context, and has already been answered. This means that the host stopped listening two minutes ago Because he thought about this very smart question, He was determined and determined to say it. We do the exact same thing. We're sitting here having a conversation with someone, And we remember that time we saw Hugh Jackman at the coffee shop. (Laughter) And stop listening. We are awaiting the moment we enter the story into the conversation About Hugh Jackman and coffee. Stories and ideas will definitely come to you. You need to let her come and go. The fifth rule: If you do not know, say that you do not know. Now, people are on the radio, especially NPR More aware that they are under registration, So they are very careful about what they claim to be expert about And they claim they know him for sure. Do it, be careful. Talk should not be cheap. The sixth rule: Your experience is not equal to their experience. If they are talking about losing a family member. Don't start talking about the time when you lost a family member. If they talk about the problems they face at work, Do not talk about how you hate your work. It's not the same thing. It is never the same. All experiences are individual. And most importantly, the conversation is not about you. You don't need to take a moment to prove how amazing you are. Or how much I suffered and suffered. Someone once asked Stephen Hawking what his IQ was and said: ""I have no idea that people who show off their wits are unsuccessful."" (Laughter) The talks are not a promotional opportunity. [21st century talks] [How are you today?] [Read my blog!] The seventh rule: Try not to repeat yourself. It is an amusement, and it is really boring. We tend to do it a lot. Especially in work conversations or when we talk with our children. We have a point we want to make clear. So we reformulate it over and over again. Do not do it. Number eight: stay away from weeds. Frankly, people don't care For years, or names, Dates, all those details That you try hard to remember in your mind. They don't care. They care about you. Care about how you are, What you have in common. So forget about the details. Leave it aside. The Ninth Rule: This is not the last, but it is the most important. listen. I can't tell you how many VIPs have said Listening is the most, and perhaps the only most important skill That you can develop. The Buddha said, I quote, ""If your mouth is open, you are not learning."" Calvin College said, ""No one is really listening on the way to losing a job."" (Laughter) Why don't we listen to each other? The first reason: We prefer to talk. When I talk, it's me who takes control. I am not obligated to hear anything that does not concern me. I am the center of attention. I can reinforce my identity. But there is another reason: There is no distraction. The average person speaks 225 words per minute. But we can hear 500 words per minute. So, our minds are filled with 275 words. And I know, it takes effort and energy, To give real attention to someone, But if you can't do that, you're not in a conversation. You are just two people exchanging screaming sentences that are hardly connected. in the same place. (Laughter) You should listen to each other. Stephen Covey said it beautifully. He said: ""Many of us do not listen with the intention of understanding. He listens with intent to respond. "" Another final rule, number 10, is as follows: be brief. [Good conversation is like a short skirt, short enough to hold attention, And long enough to cover the topic ... sister] (Laughter) (clap) All this boils down to the same basic concept, and that is: Be interested in people. As you know, I grew up with a very famous grandfather And there was some kind of ritual in our house. People would come to talk to my grandmother or grandmother. And after they left, Amy was coming to us, And she was saying, ""Do you know who this was?"" She was the runner-up to Miss America. He was the mayor of Sacramento. She won a Pulitzer Prize. He is a Russian ballet dancer. And so it arose on the assumption Everyone has something subtle and wonderful about them. Frankly, this makes me a better hostess. I try to remain as silent as possible. Keep my mind open, I am always ready for something that surprises me I have never been disappointed. Do the same Go talk to people, Listen and listen to people, Most importantly, be prepared to be surprised Thank you (clap)",0
236,"what I'm going to do here is I need to shift this log roll it so that the heart cracks on both sides are level yeah see this is the heart crack through here generally most logs will have heart crack and I want to cut that I'll just make a mark so you can see it easily yeah I want to be able to cut that out when I start cutting slabs so both sides have that heart crack lined up level I can't roll it this way because I'd be going uphill so you'll be rolling it until it's vertical or until it's all real quite a ways to go mmm so this log is about two and a half feet diameter 30 inches and it's a eight-foot log well probably nine for you I usually cut about a foot extra so this is how the pyramids were built and rocks were moved yeah but a big piece of machinery would move pretty easy but just me yeah if highways  Wow so the heart cracks one in each end they're both slightly different to each other with the casting they play twists the log twisted wood it grew probably yeah so you're kind of find the average I'm finding the average basically I want two four inch thick slabs under this to make a big bench and so fortunately the heart's way down here so I'll probably get my two slabs here easily okay the sides off with my chainsaw because I don't need to do all the milling with my Alaskan mill with that because this is all gonna be exterior so I don't want any SAP wood if it was gonna be interior I would rip the whole thing because then you get all that width but the SAP wood really rots quickly outside so you'll cut the outside off and turn it into firewood yeah just like here just like that very cool  okay I should be able to see enough of that now that it's not look at a straight line how often do you have to sharpen the saw well as long as you don't hit during anything with this kind of work not too often probably every year just four or five times I mean cut yeah it's just so that if the teeth are pretty equally cut and the same angles and sharp the saw doesn't start veering to one side it'll make a cut just pretty straight  another advantage ripping the sides off or peeling the bark off yes when you go to use your Alaskan mill it's a lot easier to cut because the bark really clogs up even where your cut is so I won't have any bark on this when I go to make my gonna be really clean  you have your foot under there when you're cutting down that bar is going through can you see it yeah yeah cut the end your foot off you gotta really watch it yeah when you're doing this kind of stuff yeah sure it's happened before  good they okay looks good so what I'm doing is I'm taking the bark up because I want to set my rail to set up my Alaskan male you don't have to do that but it makes it a lot easier just set that just set it up yeah and de nailed it on cuz you got to nail it onto the log yes so harder through the bark so what exactly is this bar um using is what the bar this is just a bar that's older than I am I got it from my father that's probably 70 80 years old uh-huh this is for its uh originally I think was used for setting best put fence post so you put your post in and then you tamp it down like that around the post  multi-functional oh yeah I must have yeah I use it leverage yeah it's just great for leverage I couldn't move his log otherwise yeah that makes it peel off like a butter  the logs been sitting here for months sometimes it gets a little easier to take off okay what I'm doing now is I'm putting this rail that I've made it's straight and each side is parallel to each side on the rail so if I get this set up correctly I'll cut a even slab off of the blog with my mill so what comes into play now are the lines I've made because that means that I can measure down to this level line that I created earlier on each side of my guide here then on each side over there and then I'll be able to cut down to the line with my Alaskan meal so this you call this a board what do you call this as my guide you guys did you make you use this for all your jobs have you made it for this job oh I use this for all of my milling jobs I made this a number of years ago I have another piece that goes on to it and I can cut 25 feet long so this is twelve and a half inches on this side and I have 12 and 3/8 on this side so and shim it up a little and try to get that  twelve and a half so after I get it all Eve equal on each side I'll nail it to the log so on this side you're also bringing it to 12 and a half inches right yeah twelve and a half inches to the line from the top of the board on each side of my guide and each side of the each side of the log so now I'm at 12 and a half here and twelve and F here now I have to check the other side because I pivoted it may have changed mm-hmm twelve and a half inches from the top of the guide in all four positions on both sides of the log so now I'll nail it down and I can use my Alaskan mill great so when you nail it down are you nailing through those shims on purpose through the sham so they stay in place because the Alaskan mill really vibrates a lot and in my brain out so the nail goes through the guide through the shin and into the log  you just feel make sure it's dirty so you had holes there in the guide before so you kind of use the same holes over over and over sometimes it just depends on where I'm nailing it doesn't matter yeah okay now the one thing I nail the other side AII it just to make sure it's parallel and that's the advantage of having these two two sides mm-hmm and they're very close to parallel I could read this maybe a sixteenth of an inch  so if you want a flat slab like how are you determining whether it's completely parallel in Flash well I'm eyeing this edge get backing up and eyeing this edge and see that it meets that edge so it's not tweaked to is not tweaked in any way right and I'm just trying to raise this one edge about sixteenth of an inch right now I have the two sides parallel now great and if this was a longer log if it was say a 12 or 13-footer over put shingles in the center here then I'd nail it there too but this doesn't have any give in this short distance okay I only need two sets of shingles and nails to keep it accurate enough yeah okay the part where I was measuring the 12 and a half inches from the top of the guide yeah on this nailed to the log yeah because now what I want to do is I want to add up twelve and a half inches here before I put that top board on well first of all let's this is the Alaskan mill this is Alaska mill you can buy setups that are aluminum got bars that an adjustable but they get a bit pricey and you can make your own pretty easy yeah this is my Husqvarna that has a 42 inch bar on it I drilled two holes in it and put in a ready rod bolt folded and stays in place pulled it on both sides with what lock washers and then you just drill this so counter drill it so that it sits on the bar its depth thing stuff to like a step yeah so now I have all these different size blocks and I need to add up to twelve and a half inches so I'm at and I need two and a half more inches so I should have  okay there's 12 and a half so I'll just repeat that on this side so is it a particularly strong saw well it's a good table it's an old so I've had it for over 20 years mm-hmm and it's held up really well it's a big saw yeah so this is what an Alaskan mill is it's not like a it's a chainsaw with a set up on this chainsaw with a set up on it sometimes you have two chainsaws one on each side just depends on how how big a cut you're making and how big your saws are you don't have to have this big ax saw you can have a smaller saw you're just gonna be cutting smaller pieces of wood is all  that will cut right down through that line that I have on the log  I used to use just a 2 by 12 for my guide this works a lot better but a 2 by 12 will work this is about how much well this is an age structure Hou sees a plain bored playing to the instruction structures this is like a beam structure so it's a lot stronger so when I go ahead and make this cut I use a gas mask along with iron ear protection because I'm sitting right next to that motor and the fumes come right up at me and they're pretty toxic so it's a good idea to protect yourself from it yeah why more so than with a regular chainsaw well when I'm cutting with the regular saw my head's quite a ways away from the saw head and there's a breeze going through and so the wind is really taking it off I'm not getting it but with this you're really sitting right in there with it okay so now with the set up I have this board will run down the top of this now I'll be cutting right along this line and it should meet on the other side where the line is - no yeah this cuz everything is parallel and I did it with a level no and that's why I needed to shift the log so that the heart crack I was cutting out was the level tooth and then to this board for the ride along the top of that board yes while you're sewing and the bar will will cut right through that line so we'll see if it does yeah okay okay  when I first put the board on I put it on backwards and there's a reason that I have it longer on this side just for safety I like to have the board go past the end of the bar it's too easy for someone else to walk up and walk into that bar when it's when the chains running and get cut really badly so right now we're looking at how it's going to be while you're cutting right and so if somebody walks up they're gonna get to the board before they get to the the chain moving because that'll cut through you pretty fast yeah okay well I'll get the chain saw started now so just hangs on bouncing on the wood  nice come out in the line yeah good very impressive okay so now I'll remove the nails and then we can cut from the surface that I created we don't need this anymore I like how you put the shims in that makes sense they're as thick as the as the blade yeah if you don't put the shims in it drops down on the bar then you're cutting width and it'll bind your chain what you're gonna make out of this big block of wood on my pond where I have the koi I'm going to take two slabs and make a circular bench area  break your foot I can't live something like this how happy to think the top slices what's that how heavy is the top slice gonna stop sighs I would have to guess just 500 pounds I mean this is Greenwood yeah it would probably break your foot or break your leg yeah so you lever it off oh yeah I can't lift it  so now I'm going to go for cutting a 4 inch slab and so now I just change my block setting to 4 inches perfect and they should both be the same yeah so we got 4 inches now  so you have to be pretty handy to want to do this to be able to do this oh yeah it's quite a bit of work for everyone it's not for everybody but on another hand where can you go buy a 21 inch 4 inch slab that's 8 P or 9 feet long of Redwood that's all hard to cut a bench out of yeah these logs over here actually I'm just gonna be cutting into material like the two by they're in stump or by because I'm going to be replacing a dÃ¨cadence 20 years old so that you could just go out and buy all right I've got the material here for big slabs so it just makes sense to use it because I had to take the trees down anyway so a lot of your house you would have made the boards actually no I fell the trees but I had a mobile dimension milk up ah that would be just too much to do yeah that's uh I had a twenty seven thousand board feet of material cut up so that was like a look like a lumber yard I wouldn't be able to do yeah the most I've cut off it any one time is about 3,000 feet that's a lot of work  okay now I can cut off of this flat surface that I've created for my next 4-inch slab so you don't need your border you don't need the board you only need it the first time for the guide for the first guide yeah because now I can you look at this it's a really nice flat surface I mean it's really nice straight and flat super plain yeah so you wouldn't use these shingles until you're actually working along you just place them ahead of you yeah yeah just get them in place  mmm mmm mmm mmm  pretty good it's quite dangerous there I mean you're using your your foot it could be you have to be very very aware of what you're doing well it helps push it down there because you are actually pushing it and it's kind of hard to reach over and push with your arms the whole day I know yeah your legs a lot stronger yeah okay we got a slab beautiful so I'll take it off and put it on some stickers they're parallel with each other and so that it dries fairly flat  oh nice board nice board huh ready for another chicken ass and then I should miss C on both sides  wow it's sure looking different around here cutting these logs there's just a little bit more to cut but some of my piles are very close to where the log is so I'm gonna be moving this wood to another location and then I'll finish cutting up that one log there ah sorry it's only about a foot away from your stack of wood right I need quite a bit of room for the saw because the blade extends you know a couple feet so maybe you've got like 30 or 40 boards here since we were last with you oh yeah yeah I cut up this time in a combination of two by and four by I just cut up according to what my usage is going to be yes so I have to replace a deck and so I'll need some 4 by material and then a lot of 2 by so that's how I decided to cut this time so on top of the pile there's like a thinner board yeah what I do often is I cut out the center where the heart goes through because often there'll be a crack through that and it makes the wood not usable so I'll cut like I cut just an inch out here and it's just not a very usable it's not reusable so I just cut that out because I don't want that crack to go into the next piece like this was the next piece uncut and it's a floor boy and I don't want that crack going into it so then I just use it as the cover board I see there's a little crack there in the end yeah crack here you can see it a little more clearly these are a couple more that I'm not you seeing right now cover boards but see this crack mm-hmm see it goes diagonally vertically in some areas and kind of diagonally oh yeah making the wood pretty useless in that area yeah except for a cover board yeah cover board good and I might you recover a little bit of the wood but not much yeah then sometimes you notice that one's even it's one inch everywhere this one goes from about two inches to one inch yeah sometimes the crack that goes through the heart which is typical in most trees you'll get that mm-hmm it doesn't it's not going parallel with my cuts the way I laid out the log it twists it'll twist as it moves through and this one twisted a bit so there was more waste on one side so what I do is I just used my guide again that I have right here when I get down to the heart crack and I set it up on it and then I can cut out a shape that I take more out on one side than the other so I don't get that heart crack into the next piece of wood into your primary boards that you're cutting right so now these cover boards will you be able to use them later or like what happens to them with like how many months will you leave these wood piles stats to season it just depends on what the usage is uh-huh the deck I'll probably use it in a couple months mm-hmm it'll dry some it's not essential that it dries mm-hmm because when you go to the lumberyard and buy redwood to build a deck it's wet mm-hmm it just depends on the usage right the one thing about the cover board though is it does help keep the top piece out of the Sun because the Sun does make it crack more quickly and more more quickly until it's dried to some extent so you leave these board these stacks of wood summer on your property out in the weather for a number of months oh yeah with your hoverboard yeah yeah see what happens is if if this is exposed to the Sun before it dries to some extent yeah this top part will dry before this bottom part too quickly one dry evenly mm-hmm and so that that means that part of the piece of wood is bigger than the other part and so then it starts doing all sorts of weird things because it's not dry drawing evenly yeah great yeah so anyway this is the project almost completed now almost completed and ready for me to just so these remaining pieces with lots of bark on them they can become firewood yeah all the rest of the material that I've left that I've cut from already will become firewood just as I have stacked between the trees and this is the one log here that's very close to the pile so you'll shift the pile of wood and I just don't want to double have to double move it so I'll move the pile of wood where it's gonna go and then I'll finish well it sure is interesting yeah it's an interesting way to produce your own wood if you have it you know the trees on your property and you need to take them down yeah yeah not not easy work no not easy work but then on the other hand you either are going to go to work and earn the money yeah to buy the wood or you or you do this and you have the wood you just get all the in-between stuff wonderful yeah yeah very cool great thanks sure you bet go mill your own wood",0
193,a lot of ultrarunners have struggles or addictions and like what allows us to go so deep into a pain cave and I keep thinking what is it that allows Kourtney to Walter to go into her  [Music]  Portland do Walter was the first woman over the line this weekend at the 2018 western states endurance drivers Courtney do Walter Nadeau Walter has set an American record in 24-hour running she won the Moab okay yeah I heard before D rather heard about it yes she she beat all the men by 22 miles you have had success on the track success from your my own racing you've had success that shorter stuff 50 miles what's the deal when you talk to her she seems so normal there's no team in there like waiting to meet a demon right you know I'm like where's your demon like are you getting through that ha ha her demons a quiet demon right it's it's there it has to be  copy six o'clock in the morning three hours to race time it's good right I mean I'd like to see how fast I could do 200 miles now that I have like confidence in my legs that they can cover that distance I'd like to see how much more efficient we can be with it it's not a full cup of you finished this they're just topper uppers the crew is a comparative there yeah their job is way harder this is decimal degrees and this was  anything and everything can and will go wrong so you just try to plan as much as you can up front she's doing that on a roll so my crew is my dad did you do it [Music] Mike and Stan  he's uh like a mullet business in the front party in the back kick it back [Music]  that's the secret sauce right there creamy mashed potatoes and then Mike has done tons of hundred mile races and he'll push you through some of the darkest times for sure and Kevin's just Kevin I think every one of her Pacers are gonna say the same concern is that she's gonna drop them I'm a mid pack guy you know and I know it's 200 miles or whatever political can run but it's working well socks do we choose to take or do you think lucky thinks perfect hopefully she doesn't run another six thirty or faster mile like she did at the end of Moab because I almost got dropped there and I think getting dropped twice a year would be embarrassing x-factors having dick when I was growing up he didn't miss one of my sports of us so cool than have him here my number one I feel like as a crew we'll be successful if at the end of the race Courtney feels like she did everything she could that she got the most out of the race [Music]  [Music]  I think that she can do the race in two days the course record is 58 hours so maybe we're in over our heads but and we're gonna try it and if things go go south and we'll troubleshoot and figure it out [Music] I set goals like that just so that I'll like hold myself accountable to keep pushing when it gets hard and not to like I don't know like settle and be like oh that's fine we'll just finish it like I want to keep yeah like pushing through and seeing seeing how fast we can do it and so the goal is you know win this thing because that's gonna make sure that I keep looking for the next person  [Music] I think I get concerned with any race it's just it's a lot all right guys yeah  [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]  she has such a genuine love for being outside and just running and pushing herself to see what she can possibly do you'll hear a talk about and it's genuine we talk about it when we're running together just on a you know summer run I think it's just curiosity she's always had the desire to do her best we always told her we didn't care what you did as long as you tried your hardest at and it may be stuck wear my lucky shirt oh Emily she had a maliki socks I couldn't ask for better people we're just very grateful that we had people that can put down 40 plus miles [Applause] [Music]  yeah we're guessing 1015 warriors you came through 10:30 so Wow like clockwork I'm so good at guessing you know quick  [Applause]  [Music] I have been running my whole life she had done her first 50-miler when we met and she asked do you want to pace me for a hundred mile errands like you're gonna have to explain like I didn't know that was something people did the 100 mile race didn't go so well I mean I was like laying on the side of the trail just kind of whimpering and then decided to drop out of it trying to sit with the fact that I had just quit got me like really fired up and I was doing a hundred mile race then and it wasn't going to be an option of quitting  so I guess people would say that my run rabbit run 100 win kind of like made waves maybe where people were like who's this person in long shorts and what is she doing at the top of the podium her ultra awards they're all kind of tucked away in and storage that was pretty awesome that Courtney got the cotton candy won because she loves can buy so embarrassed she just would never brag about her accomplishments have been really interesting watching her progression I'm retired professionally retired so yeah I would pro teaching jobs will always be there and we've got something that I could go back to it's like living my dream everyday I wake up and get to look at the Front Range of Colorado and choose where I go that day and for how long I feel really lucky to be able to be doing that and we'll see how long it is [Music]  I have to waffle and Cucina she was definitely ahead of schedule and I think at one point we know she was coming to age stations 2025 minutes ahead of where we were expecting her there's some athletes that come into the sport and like hit hit it being successful right off the bat right well with her she's had failures that she's had to learn from and so her progressions been very natural and just amazing it's like okay I've done that she knows she can do it right so what's the next boundary right what boundary can I break  it was just baking hot and I think it was just so hot and so sunny and no wind at all that everybody got overheated [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]  [Music]  [Music] and she definitely got she was struggling to eat enough calories and her stomach got upset because of the heat is my guess more anything we can to that you can take and I mean if you want to carry what she's quite nauseous yeah yes like I eat that big Newton in Leadville right  honestly my biggest concern was that she was not gonna get enough calories and just have a major bonk you know we were just like Suns going down pretty soon she'll be able to be running when it's a little cooler  [Applause] [Music] [Applause]  going back up  yeah see you soon great okay see you  in a few races when things really start to go south you can kind of see the gears turning like I know I know this feeling I've been here before it used to push her to the point where she would get I mean sometimes really emotional like she'd start crying but now she's like okay and I know this happens and I just need to be strong she just has this ability to be hating life and be able to push through that I think she's an incredible problem solver and she can figure this stuff out and tune into what her body wants and pays attention to herself it as much as we all think that she's a goofball and she doesn't pay attention to anything she's very in tune with what's going on around her how are you  [Music] thirsty posed to mental oh but then it also became physical when I was like throwing up you know everything I was eating the first day so I was like hit two times by these like weird things that don't normally happen until past the first date usually this was unique I've never been in a low for so long and had no reason for it like great from the get-go my brain was in just a weird state for it was like not processing that I was racing and getting to do this thing and so everything just felt like more of an effort  you know Kyle was you know had kind of separated himself when I had picked her up I had checked where he was and we were about eight miles ahead of him maybe nine miles ahead of him right around there and then we got to the next aid station they told us he was at seventy-five miles or something like that but which basically put him five miles behind us or something and all of a sudden Courtney's like he's closed three miles on us she was just like we got to go and she just started to pound it up the hill and right out of that aid station you do this huge climb like four or five miles and it's steep and rocky and she was running  [Music]  turns out we basically maintain the same and a distance she was just not able to run as hard as she normally felt like she should you know I feel like if she had been able to not have the stomach issues from the heat I'm totally confident she could have been running a lot of this stuff quicker than we're going in at a harder paced and we were going but you just got to fight through that  good yeah I'm good I got plenty of time to drink dude you just crushed it so bad everything I could do to stay with you dude  so what's the next section do the next section is out ten miles and it goes up for a while then goes down  [Applause]  normally in these ultros I ride a high and then a low and then high again and this one was just like it started and kind of a low and then just sunk a little bit deeper and then stayed there like I couldn't find the other side of it ever for the first 20 hours I think I was just like fighting for every mile which normally doesn't happen normally there's more highs in that first Park especially but I couldn't find it for some reason I don't know what factors were going into that  learned a lot of hard lessons in those those first ones but since then I mean every every race she's kind of fine-tuned more and more and I don't know if there any secrets in this sport but she's kind of figured out how to get through just about anything  they're just not sitting well cuz their stomach so I'm side down so maybe pancakes and maple syrup God knows I would have eaten it because it's training up and it's a lot love them yeah she came in and we're like do you want to try some pancakes we had two cheese quesadillas and we're like if you want to try some pancakes with some syrup and she's like that sounds good alright she got a little piece down and I was like she's deleting so yeah it's like five o'clock in the afternoon we know it's hot and sunny we'd like a cheese quesadilla and there's some pancakes I think she relies on the fact that no matter what happens we're still on her team we still love her to death this is this is icing I mean this is fun you know and if this all goes the way tomorrow god did we have a freaking ball so much of it comes from her mom and dad her humility her overall approach to life it's too important to enjoy your life to get all worked up about the little things  she doesn't run ultras to get interviews and be in magazines she runs sculptures because she loves to run  [Music] [Applause] so the time you're going about seven days I have to like pick up so  see you tonight seven huh yep have fun second place I think he's only like 12 five miles back now he's been he's been cruising he's coming he's coming in one battle would be real fun [Music]  whoa see she's gonna probably just want to look at the profile and I have the sheet on my favorite tunes by cooking so nineteen thirteen and a half six nine  she got hooked up with a coach in high school for cross-country skiing his name was Randy Gibbs and he was really really good at getting every little drop of talent out of these girls that he coached he kind of taught them the idea that you could go away faster than you think you can and you can go away farther and you think you can and after being with him she figured out how to go really far going and competing in Alaska in the winter and having to deal with the cold where they had duct tape on their face so they wouldn't get frostbite and all that kind of stuff and she went through a lot of this pain and suffering and learned from a very young age that that's not the end of the world  she came into Sierra Tahoe her high school cross-country ski coach was out there to see her I mean you could just see her light up this is a man who had a profound impact on her her cape boys as an athlete this is the guy he taught me everything I know about basically going into the pain cave like that place where it really hurts he was the one who taught us how to go in there and be okay with it you got anything I need to know about  I've been down this road here with her she's a stud out there they go away  and it was really cool then to have it like come back full circle horns for him to be there with his daughter nice to meet you thanks for coming I'm not a crier but that was really emotional and like just really special to see him again  sophomore year she went from being like pretty good to all Son winning all the races basically like she just realized this I don't like going second she went from being someone that didn't really ski she was a runner you know and next scene when she's winning the state meet and skiing people have been skiing for ten years longer than her I think that's it it's a burning will to be the best she hates losing more than she likes winning him you know we had six mile lead maybe at that time and we know it had closed down to within two she was in the pain cave for I was with her for 11 and a half hours out there on the trail and you know there wasn't a whole lot of highs for her unfortunate was just a lot of I got to do it you know  they're 19 miles in into the segment route spacing urn she was just like well that kind of sucked you know whatever my guy he did great and she said Mike just be mad with me for a minute or whatever so I was like yeah I kind of suck you know and she's like okay no service I don't know it's just so what she might quickly gave us the update that yeah she's fighting to sleep and sleep running this is quite an adventure  well that's that tough GPL you know the only tough Chiefs get to do it yes I'm gonna give up let's end this delirious sleepless society  [Music]  really  was a little hard on her I think she was kind of anticipating it because people had been feeding her information that he was getting closer and closer and I think when he was about two miles away it was 30 miles from the finish and she is like I can't redline this for 30 miles I'm just gonna do what I can do and if he passes me so be it I'll try to catch him again  he was a lot more rugged and I was anticipating I think it was more rugged than the first half of the race just couldn't open or not back she just went open it up a little bit they can see each other's headlamps I'm sure my guess is I'm super competitive I mean if if I could have I would have held on and held them off  it had been such a hard day from the very GetGo and there we were like 40 hours in or whatever you know when he finally passed and it was like I don't know if I can fight anymore  so this is the last aid station Kyle last check was a little ahead of her she'll just give it or go and see if she can reel him in hurry up and we hope she's not disappointed or upset I think she gave her best right I mean she wasn't out there quitting she was fighting the whole way and that's how you can ask for right it's just put on table and a sudden you know something beating somebody beats you but she's not off to compete the women's team other runners and I think that's pretty special great job Cort and she looks at me and she's like 50 I got to get in before 50  you want any of that and I need to please the 50 our goal is one of those things that did really get her fired up and gather  remember that yeah seven miles okay yeah got a new character I think I just had to set something like we had missed the other goals we had you know the other like big aspiration that we had for the race and we were looking at the clock and I was like is 5th a sub 50 our finished possible and he did some math and he was like yeah but you're gonna have to work for it and then I was like okay fine like let's let's do this because I needed a reason at that point to keep pushing really hard because it hurt so bad and that was the perfect like you know carrot today we've gotten run 40 minutes go get it he's the ultimate crew chief and and pacer [Music]  I joke like you know he's just Kevin but he's like the whole thing was everything [Music] she's got no a gift but her full physical abilities have come from so much hard work [Music]  she's gotten a lot stronger because she worked so hard but that's not I mean that's what I've seen more change but the foundation of all that work is she's so strong oh man sorry this is really telling you Hallett how amazed I am house she's just a really amazing person what I've seen in like the last three years just her physical ability is developed so much from all the hard work that she's done where she would go run a hundred mile race and for like five six days afterwards she would be wrecked ultimately be able to function after a week and now it's like she does a hundred mile race the next day yeah she can't sleep you know she's fatigued her body's killing her but within two or three days we're doing shakeout runs or we're you know running around in her ability to recover has been just amazing compared to what she was several years ago I don't think there's anything in particular that's unique about her per se I think it's something that other people can do I do think she's gifted genetically with she's just wired a little differently maybe something that Courtney has learned and that she's gotten really good at is that when you think your body is telling you to stop like maybe you don't need to stop and it's a challenging thing to do but it's absolutely possible for anyone she's not running away from anything she's just running towards the to see what can be really darkness  [Music] [Applause]  I was still thinking about her goal of getting to you know under 50 hours she was really hoping to get in by 11 so she has less than 20 minutes to get them those last two miles she's close really close [Music] Kevin how we doing right to the last moment when you just push yourself to see what you can achieve [Music]  I think it went incredibly well Courtney had nothing left when she crossed the line first of all she didn't drop any of us so truth be told we're all fired up about Dec we had so much fun I don't think she's ever satisfied I mean she always knows that it's always possible to go faster I've even seen where she's won a race and been frustrated that she didn't do as well as she could have we talked about how it was all going when I was pacing her she said this isn't going nearly as well as Moab but it's almost refreshing like a reminder that things aren't always gonna go well they can go very very poorly but even so you can still do a great job I need to come back and do it better basically the whole second half I'd like to change if I could I don't know yeah I mean situationally we had like things come up that we had a problem solve which I love doing but we just didn't solve them as fast as I wanted like I didn't solve them as fast as I wanted and so it caused the second half of the race did you just be much slower but that's okay that's part of the fun really I'm even more proud of her then and it wasn't Moab seeing how hard it was on her and not being able to eat for 140 miles that's really hard on your body and for her to keep pushing through that and move at this speed dad was incredible and if there's any lesson that I've learned is you can never be too surprised at what Courtney can do I don't think yet she's found that breaking point there's gonna be some good stuff to come yeah we're gonna see from her Whitman just she's capable  you  everybody's got a demon yeah I don't I don't know that I have a demon I think I don't like to fail and I want to finish everything that I start is that a demon [Music]  [Music] you,0
