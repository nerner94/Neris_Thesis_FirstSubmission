Blacks don't commit NEARLY as many crimes as Whites. \n","\n","The reason that this false narrative has worked in a sense of manipulating the perception of U.S citizens is because, the media only highlights the little crime that Blacks commit.

In Zambia, the rate of HIV infection among teenage girls is five to seven times the rate for boys — largely the result of forcible sex with older men. Although a great many rapes in Africa go unreported, in Zimbabwe the number reported increased 30 percent in the last five years. In 1997, more than half of the victims were children, many younger than five. Some young girls are raped by their own fathers or relatives. Many women now report that they are afraid to leave their daughters alone with any man, no matter how close a relative.  \n","One Zimbabwe rapist who called himself “King AIDS” was recently sentenced to life in prison for knowingly infecting an eight-year-old. “We even have cases of children still in \\[diapers\\] being raped,” says Jacqueline Pratt, acting chief magistrate of the criminal courts in Harare, the capital city.  \n","Zorodzai Machekanyanga, who heads an AIDS group for women in Zimbabwe, says the problem is rooted in African culture. “The girl child has no value in African society; she is a thing to be used to make men’s lives better.” Women are also thought to be the source of sexually transmitted diseases. In Shona, the majority language in Zimbabwe, AIDS and syphilis are literally called “women’s diseases.”  \n","Although child rape has come under increasing scrutiny because it has become a conduit for AIDS, it is an old practice in Africa.

blacks don t commit nearly as many crimes as whites the reason that this false narrative has worked in a sense of manipulating the perception of u s citizens is because the media only highlights the

you start to see evidence of humans being exposed whether the virus would then adapt to the new host remains to be seen he said another extract how it might behave if it does make the switch to humans is difficult to predict although measles infection can have devastating complications this is rarer compared to cdv and some of the other morbilliviruses which normally produce severe disease in their natural hosts said prof cosby cdv is very virulent and normally will infect the brain in the later stages of the disease whereas with measles this is a rare but really dangerous event this is not the only cause of death as all morbilliviruses including cdv cause immune suppression in their host which can lead to secondary bacterial infections giving rise particularly to pneumonia and in some cases

fbi fisa abuses were directed by the cia the fbi is mearly acting on cia direction we know that the cia through epstein and other similar operations like nvixm and the finders as well as likely others we have never heard about maintains and develops dirt on us politicians and media magnates like matt groening it could be that one does not end up in a position of power unless they have media of them that could ruin them perhaps schiff felt the impeachment was too far and was looking at how well he would do going off the path and decided that wouldn t work out for him so he agreed to his assigned position of organizing the impeachment witnesses and proceedings the whole thing stinks of top down direction from someone outside of congress who doesn t understand politics nancy pelosi expressed at one point that going forward with this would be overly ambitious and a bad idea it seems she may have been right considering they are now stuck holding onto it because the way forward would not be politically advantageous for them the whole thing smacks of a top down director that doesn t plan very well and doesn t have good political foresight nancy pelosi has good political foresight that s why they keep reelecting her as speaker of the house she doesn t make these kinds of mistakes on her own the real reason it was rushed forward was because they had external forces demanding that they get going and who were going to view any hesitation or delay as soft refusal which they wouldn t accept nancy likely warned them she clearly had some intuition that this wasn t a well thought out path forward and it s implausible that she would paint herself into a corner given how much experience she has edit i keep getting notifications from people who end up deleting their comments realizing they don t know what they are talking about i may have made some people salty i m leaving this timeline of violations to address people who say there was no fisa abuse lol this isn t even the first

anyone truly thought about what a trippy concept this is so the sun is minutes in the past the nearest star is light years away thats years in the past this makes me think each planet has its own unique timeline for example mars is a barren wasteland if we went to alpha centaur and then came back would we be in mars past or future and if everything is in the past that could also explain why people see full bodied apparitions of spirits from time to time because everything is in the past nothing is present all timelines exist at the same time and occasionally overlap on earth which explains why we haven t made contact with et yet officially however since every planet exists with its own unique timelines could it be that the only present is when you are in a vacuum like space the planets gravity protects us from present yet when we are in the iss we are actually in the earths future but by a few minutes but not quite in space officially as the planets gravity still protects the station and the moon we as humans have technically never left earths gravity the moon is the farthest point we as humans have physically reached the only objects to ever leave the planets gravity

appeared on sunday s edition of msnbc s weekends where he expounded on the anti semitic attack at a hanukkah party in monsey n y that left five people with stab wounds by the time of the mayor s appearance the assailant had been apprehended in harlem by new york police still wearing the blood stained clothing he had had on during the machete attack and his photograph plainly revealing him to

the forces of hate have been unleashed and we see more and more violence associated with those hateful impulses we ve also known for years that there are white supremacists forces that are organizing to do violence we know about the militias in some parts of the country they ve targeted law enforcement these right wing militias have targeted law enforcement for years in this country unfortunately

assailants armed to the teeth stormed a kosher supermarket in jersey city earlier this month the women of the view likewise blamed the killings on white supremacy never mind that the two gunmen david

specific cases of blacks knowingly spreading hiv aids have been brought to my attention they have been added to the chronological list below thanks to everyone who helped me put together this list eastern and southern african nations have higher rates of hiv aids than the rest of the world blacks in the united states also have higher infection rates than non whites many migrants from sub saharan africa also contract the disease once they arrive in europe what causes this first many africans hold outlandish theories about the ways hiv aids can be contracted cured or treated one horrifying belief is that sex with a virgin will cure aids the inevitable result is child rape in the los angeles times reported this belief has lead sic to an epidemic of child rape it is hard to find a virgin of nowadays so men are turning to babies under says mamelato leopeng an aids worker from south africa because one in four adult males are infected with hiv in some parts of africa they are infecting large numbers of young girls in zambia the rate of hiv infection among teenage girls is five to seven times the rate for boys largely the result of forcible sex with older men although a great many rapes in africa go unreported in zimbabwe the number reported increased percent in the last five years in more than half of the victims were children many younger than five some young girls

getting deleted almost a year ago i saw a video that started with human trafficking as the main topic and ended up talking about a family friendly restaurant in washington dc the owner of the restaurant had multiple disturbing images of art hanging on the walls of the rooms basically what was displayed was people sexually physically as well as psychologically abusing children of younger age what most people didn t really realize to that given time tho was in my opinion not just people and children being on those pictures but also something that appeared to me like ghosts or astral entities which creeps me out it feels to me that a lot of people were paying attention to something horrifying that was happening all arround us but forgot about what those images might have been on the other side of the coin too some time ago i watched a german show where a host wears a big headset he usually talks about peoples problems once a woman of a cult called him and told him how horrible she felt because she and her cult were working on intentionally scaring the living hell out of children to disassociate them from reality she said that the rooms and environments they usually did this in looked like a one way ticket to them going in without return a pure horror rooms completely isolated from any noise to the outside world chains hanging from the roofs poor lighting and chainsaws and other equipment for sick freaks playing their little game with those poor children she said that they make children feel like they are going to die but don t really kill them at some point he asked her why they did it but then she left with all the information i gathered over the months i only can think of mk ultra and that these terribly abused children will be the people in power of tomorrow from the pictures in the restaurant i can only think that they seem the next ones to torture the next generation and so on the child that got tortured was the one having an out of body experiance on other pictures the adult person suddenly with the astral projection was now the one torturing a child now to be honest i can t see the full picture with the out of body experiance
